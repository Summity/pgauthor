<body><p>34:9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</p>
<p>34:10 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</p>
<p>34:11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</p>
<p>34:12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</p>
<p>34:13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? 34:14 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; 34:15 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</p>
<p>34:16 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</p>
<p>34:17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? 34:18 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly? 34:19 How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</p>
<p>34:20 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</p>
<p>34:21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</p>
<p>34:22 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
<p>34:23 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</p>
<p>34:24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</p>
<p>34:25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p>
<p>34:26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 34:27 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: 34:28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p>34:29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only: 34:30 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</p>
<p>34:31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more: 34:32 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</p>
<p>34:33 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</p>
<p>34:34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</p>
<p>34:35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</p>
<p>34:36 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</p>
<p>34:37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</p>
<p>35:1 Elihu spake moreover, and said, 35:2 Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's? 35:3 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin? 35:4 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</p>
<p>35:5 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.</p>
<p>35:6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? 35:7 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? 35:8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.</p>
<p>35:9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>
<p>35:10 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; 35:11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? 35:12 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</p>
<p>35:13 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>
<p>35:14 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</p>
<p>35:15 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity: 35:16 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</p>
<p>36:1 Elihu also proceeded, and said, 36:2 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.</p>
<p>36:3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>
<p>36:4 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</p>
<p>36:5 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</p>
<p>36:6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</p>
<p>36:7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</p>
<p>36:8 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; 36:9 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</p>
<p>36:10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</p>
<p>36:11 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</p>
<p>36:12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</p>
<p>36:13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</p>
<p>36:14 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</p>
<p>36:15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</p>
<p>36:16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</p>
<p>36:17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</p>
<p>36:18 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</p>
<p>36:19 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</p>
<p>36:20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</p>
<p>36:21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</p>
<p>36:22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 36:23 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? 36:24 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</p>
<p>36:25 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</p>
<p>36:26 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</p>
<p>36:27 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: 36:28 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</p>
<p>36:29 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle? 36:30 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>36:31 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</p>
<p>36:32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</p>
<p>36:33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</p>
<p>37:1 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</p>
<p>37:2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p>37:3 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>37:4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</p>
<p>37:5 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>37:6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</p>
<p>37:7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</p>
<p>37:8 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</p>
<p>37:9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</p>
<p>37:10 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</p>
<p>37:11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: 37:12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</p>
<p>37:13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</p>
<p>37:14 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p>37:15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine? 37:16 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? 37:17 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind? 37:18 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass? 37:19 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</p>
<p>37:20 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</p>
<p>37:21 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</p>
<p>37:22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</p>
<p>37:23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</p>
<p>37:24 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.</p>
<p>38:1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 38:2 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? 38:3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</p>
<p>38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</p>
<p>38:5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? 38:6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; 38:7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 38:8 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb? 38:9 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, 38:10 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, 38:11 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? 38:12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place; 38:13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? 38:14 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.</p>
<p>38:15 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.</p>
<p>38:16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 38:17 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? 38:18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.</p>
<p>38:19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof, 38:20 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? 38:21 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great? 38:22 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, 38:23 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? 38:24 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? 38:25 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; 38:26 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; 38:27 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? 38:28 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? 38:29 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? 38:30 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</p>
<p>38:31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? 38:32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? 38:33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? 38:34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? 38:35 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are? 38:36 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? 38:37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, 38:38 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? 38:39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, 38:40 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? 38:41 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</p>
<p>39:1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 39:2 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 39:3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.</p>
<p>39:4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.</p>
<p>39:5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 39:6 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.</p>
<p>39:7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.</p>
<p>39:8 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.</p>
<p>39:9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? 39:10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 39:11 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? 39:12 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? 39:13 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? 39:14 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, 39:15 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.</p>
<p>39:16 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear; 39:17 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</p>
<p>39:18 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.</p>
<p>39:19 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? 39:20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.</p>
<p>39:21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.</p>
<p>39:22 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.</p>
<p>39:23 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.</p>
<p>39:24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.</p>
<p>39:25 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>
<p>39:26 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? 39:27 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? 39:28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.</p>
<p>39:29 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.</p>
<p>39:30 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.</p>
<p>40:1 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 40:2 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</p>
<p>40:3 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 40:4 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</p>
<p>40:5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</p>
<p>40:6 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 40:7 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>
<p>40:8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 40:9 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 40:10 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</p>
<p>40:11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.</p>
<p>40:12 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</p>
<p>40:13 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.</p>
<p>40:14 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</p>
<p>40:15 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</p>
<p>40:16 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.</p>
<p>40:17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</p>
<p>40:18 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.</p>
<p>40:19 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.</p>
<p>40:20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</p>
<p>40:21 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</p>
<p>40:22 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</p>
<p>40:23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</p>
<p>40:24 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.</p>
<p>41:1 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? 41:2 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 41:3 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? 41:4 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? 41:5 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 41:6 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? 41:7 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? 41:8 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</p>
<p>41:9 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? 41:10 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? 41:11 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</p>
<p>41:12 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</p>
<p>41:13 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? 41:14 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.</p>
<p>41:15 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</p>
<p>41:16 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</p>
<p>41:17 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</p>
<p>41:18 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p>
<p>41:19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.</p>
<p>41:20 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.</p>
<p>41:21 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p>41:22 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>
<p>41:23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</p>
<p>41:24 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</p>
<p>41:25 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</p>
<p>41:26 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</p>
<p>41:27 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</p>
<p>41:28 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</p>
<p>41:29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</p>
<p>41:30 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</p>
<p>41:31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>
<p>41:32 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</p>
<p>41:33 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</p>
<p>41:34 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.</p>
<p>42:1 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 42:2 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.</p>
<p>42:3 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</p>
<p>42:4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>
<p>42:5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</p>
<p>42:6 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</p>
<p>42:7 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</p>
<p>42:8 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</p>
<p>42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</p>
<p>42:10 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</p>
<p>42:11 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</p>
<p>42:12 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</p>
<p>42:13 He had also seven sons and three daughters.</p>
<p>42:14 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</p>
<p>42:15 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</p>
<p>42:16 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.</p>
<p>42:17 So Job died, being old and full of days.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00020"><a id="The_Book_of_Psalms"/>The Book of Psalms</h3>
<p>1:1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p>
<p>1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</p>
<p>1:3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p>
<p>1:4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</p>
<p>1:5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p>
<p>1:6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</p>
<p>2:1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>
<p>2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,</p>
<p>2:3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>
<p>2:4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.</p>
<p>2:5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</p>
<p>2:6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>
<p>2:7 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</p>
<p>2:8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</p>
<p>2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</p>
<p>2:10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</p>
<p>2:11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>
<p>2:12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>
<p>3:1 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.</p>
<p>3:2 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God.</p>
<p>Selah.</p>
<p>3:3 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.</p>
<p>3:4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</p>
<p>3:5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.</p>
<p>3:6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.</p>
<p>3:7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</p>
<p>3:8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people.</p>
<p>Selah.</p>
<p>4:1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</p>
<p>4:2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.</p>
<p>4:3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.</p>
<p>4:4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</p>
<p>4:5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.</p>
<p>4:6 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</p>
<p>4:7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.</p>
<p>4:8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.</p>
<p>5:1 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</p>
<p>5:2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</p>
<p>5:3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</p>
<p>5:4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</p>
<p>5:5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</p>
<p>5:6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</p>
<p>5:7 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</p>
<p>5:8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</p>
<p>5:9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</p>
<p>5:10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</p>
<p>5:11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</p>
<p>5:12 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.</p>
<p>6:1 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>
<p>6:2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.</p>
<p>6:3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?</p>
<p>6:4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.</p>
<p>6:5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?</p>
<p>6:6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.</p>
<p>6:7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.</p>
<p>6:8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.</p>
<p>6:9 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.</p>
<p>6:10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.</p>
<p>7:1 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:</p>
<p>7:2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</p>
<p>7:3 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</p>
<p>7:4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)</p>
<p>7:5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.</p>
<p>7:6 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.</p>
<p>7:7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</p>
<p>7:8 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.</p>
<p>7:9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</p>
<p>7:10 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.</p>
<p>7:11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.</p>
<p>7:12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>
<p>7:13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.</p>
<p>7:14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</p>
<p>7:15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.</p>
<p>7:16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</p>
<p>7:17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</p>
<p>8:1 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.</p>
<p>8:2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.</p>
<p>8:3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</p>
<p>8:4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>
<p>8:5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</p>
<p>8:6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:</p>
<p>8:7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;</p>
<p>8:8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.</p>
<p>8:9 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!</p>
<p>9:1 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.</p>
<p>9:2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.</p>
<p>9:3 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.</p>
<p>9:4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.</p>
<p>9:5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.</p>
<p>9:6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.</p>
<p>9:7 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.</p>
<p>9:8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</p>
<p>9:9 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.</p>
<p>9:10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</p>
<p>9:11 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.</p>
<p>9:12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.</p>
<p>9:13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:</p>
<p>9:14 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
<p>9:15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</p>
<p>9:16 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.</p>
<p>9:17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.</p>
<p>9:18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.</p>
<p>9:19 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.</p>
<p>9:20 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.</p>
<p>10:1 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?</p>
<p>10:2 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</p>
<p>10:3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.</p>
<p>10:4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.</p>
<p>10:5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</p>
<p>10:6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.</p>
<p>10:7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.</p>
<p>10:8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.</p>
<p>10:9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</p>
<p>10:10 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.</p>
<p>10:11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.</p>
<p>10:12 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.</p>
<p>10:13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.</p>
<p>10:14 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</p>
<p>10:15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.</p>
<p>10:16 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</p>
<p>10:17 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</p>
<p>10:18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</p>
<p>11:1 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?</p>
<p>11:2 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.</p>
<p>11:3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?</p>
<p>11:4 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.</p>
<p>11:5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.</p>
<p>11:6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.</p>
<p>11:7 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.</p>
<p>12:1 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.</p>
<p>12:2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.</p>
<p>12:3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:</p>
<p>12:4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?</p>
<p>12:5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.</p>
<p>12:6 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p>
<p>12:7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.</p>
<p>12:8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.</p>
<p>13:1 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</p>
<p>13:2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?</p>
<p>13:3 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;</p>
<p>13:4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.</p>
<p>13:5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
<p>13:6 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.</p>
<p>14:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.</p>
<p>14:2 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.</p>
<p>14:3 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
<p>14:4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.</p>
<p>14:5 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.</p>
<p>14:6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.</p>
<p>14:7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
<p>15:1 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?</p>
<p>15:2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.</p>
<p>15:3 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.</p>
<p>15:4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.</p>
<p>15:5 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.</p>
<p>16:1 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.</p>
<p>16:2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;</p>
<p>16:3 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</p>
<p>16:4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</p>
<p>16:5 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.</p>
<p>16:6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.</p>
<p>16:7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.</p>
<p>16:8 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</p>
<p>16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.</p>
<p>16:10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>
<p>16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</p>
<p>17:1 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.</p>
<p>17:2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.</p>
<p>17:3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.</p>
<p>17:4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.</p>
<p>17:5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.</p>
<p>17:6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.</p>
<p>17:7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.</p>
<p>17:8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,</p>
<p>17:9 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.</p>
<p>17:10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.</p>
<p>17:11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;</p>
<p>17:12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.</p>
<p>17:13 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:</p>
<p>17:14 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.</p>
<p>17:15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.</p>
<p>18:1 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</p>
<p>18:2 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</p>
<p>18:3 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p>18:4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</p>
<p>18:5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</p>
<p>18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</p>
<p>18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</p>
<p>18:8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p>18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</p>
<p>18:10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</p>
<p>18:11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p>18:12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
<p>18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
<p>18:14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</p>
<p>18:15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</p>
<p>18:16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</p>
<p>18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p>18:18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</p>
<p>18:19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<p>18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p>18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
<p>18:22 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</p>
<p>18:23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>
<p>18:24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p>
<p>18:25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</p>
<p>18:26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</p>
<p>18:27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</p>
<p>18:28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</p>
<p>18:29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>
<p>18:30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.</p>
<p>18:31 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?</p>
<p>18:32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</p>
<p>18:33 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.</p>
<p>18:34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
<p>18:35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p>18:36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</p>
<p>18:37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</p>
<p>18:38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</p>
<p>18:39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</p>
<p>18:40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p>18:41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p>
<p>18:42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p>
<p>18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</p>
<p>18:44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</p>
<p>18:45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</p>
<p>18:46 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</p>
<p>18:47 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</p>
<p>18:48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
<p>18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</p>
<p>18:50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>
<p>19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.</p>
<p>19:2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.</p>
<p>19:3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.</p>
<p>19:4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,</p>
<p>19:5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.</p>
<p>19:6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</p>
<p>19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.</p>
<p>19:8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.</p>
<p>19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.</p>
<p>19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</p>
<p>19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.</p>
<p>19:12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.</p>
<p>19:13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.</p>
<p>19:14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.</p>
<p>20:1 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;</p>
<p>20:2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;</p>
<p>20:3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.</p>
<p>20:4 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.</p>
<p>20:5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.</p>
<p>20:6 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.</p>
<p>20:7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.</p>
<p>20:8 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.</p>
<p>20:9 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.</p>
<p>21:1 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!</p>
<p>21:2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.</p>
<p>21:3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.</p>
<p>21:4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.</p>
<p>21:5 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</p>
<p>21:6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.</p>
<p>21:7 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</p>
<p>21:8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.</p>
<p>21:9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.</p>
<p>21:10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.</p>
<p>21:11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.</p>
<p>21:12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.</p>
<p>21:13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.</p>
<p>22:1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?</p>
<p>22:2 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.</p>
<p>22:3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.</p>
<p>22:4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.</p>
<p>22:5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.</p>
<p>22:6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.</p>
<p>22:7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,</p>
<p>22:8 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.</p>
<p>22:9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.</p>
<p>22:10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.</p>
<p>22:11 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.</p>
<p>22:12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.</p>
<p>22:13 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.</p>
<p>22:14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.</p>
<p>22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.</p>
<p>22:16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.</p>
<p>22:17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.</p>
<p>22:18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.</p>
<p>22:19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.</p>
<p>22:20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.</p>
<p>22:21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</p>
<p>22:22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.</p>
<p>22:23 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.</p>
<p>22:24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.</p>
<p>22:25 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.</p>
<p>22:26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.</p>
<p>22:27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.</p>
<p>22:28 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.</p>
<p>22:29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.</p>
<p>22:30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.</p>
<p>22:31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.</p>
<p>23:1 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.</p>
<p>23:2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.</p>
<p>23:3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</p>
<p>23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</p>
<p>23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</p>
<p>23:6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.</p>
<p>24:1 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</p>
<p>24:2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.</p>
<p>24:3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?</p>
<p>24:4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.</p>
<p>24:5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.</p>
<p>24:6 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.</p>
<p>24:7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.</p>
<p>24:8 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.</p>
<p>24:9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.</p>
<p>24:10 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.</p>
<p>25:1 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.</p>
<p>25:2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.</p>
<p>25:3 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.</p>
<p>25:4 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.</p>
<p>25:5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.</p>
<p>25:6 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.</p>
<p>25:7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.</p>
<p>25:8 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.</p>
<p>25:9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.</p>
<p>25:10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.</p>
<p>25:11 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.</p>
<p>25:12 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.</p>
<p>25:13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p>25:14 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.</p>
<p>25:15 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.</p>
<p>25:16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.</p>
<p>25:17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.</p>
<p>25:18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.</p>
<p>25:19 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.</p>
<p>25:20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.</p>
<p>25:21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.</p>
<p>25:22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.</p>
<p>26:1 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.</p>
<p>26:2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.</p>
<p>26:3 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.</p>
<p>26:4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.</p>
<p>26:5 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.</p>
<p>26:6 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:</p>
<p>26:7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.</p>
<p>26:8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</p>
<p>26:9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:</p>
<p>26:10 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.</p>
<p>26:11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.</p>
<p>26:12 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.</p>
<p>27:1 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?</p>
<p>27:2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.</p>
<p>27:3 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.</p>
<p>27:4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.</p>
