<body><p>29:26 Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD.</p>
<p>29:27 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.</p>
<p>30:1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, 30:2 Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.</p>
<p>30:3 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</p>
<p>30:4 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell? 30:5 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</p>
<p>30:6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</p>
<p>30:7 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: 30:8 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: 30:9 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</p>
<p>30:10 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.</p>
<p>30:11 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</p>
<p>30:12 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</p>
<p>30:13 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</p>
<p>30:14 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</p>
<p>30:15 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough: 30:16 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.</p>
<p>30:17 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</p>
<p>30:18 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: 30:19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</p>
<p>30:20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</p>
<p>30:21 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear: 30:22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat; 30:23 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</p>
<p>30:24 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise: 30:25 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer; 30:26 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; 30:27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; 30:28 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.</p>
<p>30:29 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going: 30:30 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; 30:31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.</p>
<p>30:32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.</p>
<p>30:33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</p>
<p>31:1 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</p>
<p>31:2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? 31:3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</p>
<p>31:4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: 31:5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</p>
<p>31:6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.</p>
<p>31:7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</p>
<p>31:8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.</p>
<p>31:9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>
<p>31:10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.</p>
<p>31:11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</p>
<p>31:12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</p>
<p>31:13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</p>
<p>31:14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</p>
<p>31:15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</p>
<p>31:16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</p>
<p>31:17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</p>
<p>31:18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.</p>
<p>31:19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</p>
<p>31:20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</p>
<p>31:21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</p>
<p>31:22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.</p>
<p>31:23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</p>
<p>31:24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</p>
<p>31:25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</p>
<p>31:26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.</p>
<p>31:27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</p>
<p>31:28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.</p>
<p>31:29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</p>
<p>31:30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</p>
<p>31:31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</p>

<p>or</p>
<p>The Preacher</p>
<p>1:1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>1:2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</p>
<p>1:3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? 1:4 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</p>
<p>1:5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</p>
<p>1:6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</p>
<p>1:7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</p>
<p>1:8 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>
<p>1:9 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</p>
<p>1:10 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</p>
<p>1:11 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</p>
<p>1:12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>1:13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</p>
<p>1:14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>1:15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</p>
<p>1:16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>1:17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>1:18 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>
<p>2:1 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.</p>
<p>2:2 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 2:3 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</p>
<p>2:4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: 2:5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: 2:6 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: 2:7 I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: 2:8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</p>
<p>2:9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</p>
<p>2:10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</p>
<p>2:11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</p>
<p>2:12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.</p>
<p>2:13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</p>
<p>2:14 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</p>
<p>2:15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</p>
<p>2:16 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten.</p>
<p>And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</p>
<p>2:17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>2:18 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</p>
<p>2:19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</p>
<p>2:20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</p>
<p>2:21 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</p>
<p>2:22 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? 2:23 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</p>
<p>2:24 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</p>
<p>2:25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I? 2:26 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>3:1 To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: 3:2 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; 3:3 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; 3:4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; 3:5 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; 3:6 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; 3:7 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; 3:8 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</p>
<p>3:9 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? 3:10 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</p>
<p>3:11 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p>3:12 I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</p>
<p>3:13 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</p>
<p>3:14 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</p>
<p>3:15 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</p>
<p>3:16 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.</p>
<p>3:17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</p>
<p>3:18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</p>
<p>3:19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</p>
<p>3:20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</p>
<p>3:21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? 3:22 Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? 4:1 So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</p>
<p>4:2 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</p>
<p>4:3 Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>
<p>4:4 Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>4:5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</p>
<p>4:6 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>4:7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</p>
<p>4:8 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.</p>
<p>4:9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</p>
<p>4:10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.</p>
<p>4:11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? 4:12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
<p>4:13 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</p>
<p>4:14 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</p>
<p>4:15 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</p>
<p>4:16 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>5:1 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.</p>
<p>5:2 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.</p>
<p>5:3 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.</p>
<p>5:4 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</p>
<p>5:5 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</p>
<p>5:6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? 5:7 For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God.</p>
<p>5:8 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.</p>
<p>5:9 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.</p>
<p>5:10 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.</p>
<p>5:11 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes? 5:12 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</p>
<p>5:13 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</p>
<p>5:14 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.</p>
<p>5:15 As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</p>
<p>5:16 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? 5:17 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.</p>
<p>5:18 Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.</p>
<p>5:19 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.</p>
<p>5:20 For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.</p>
<p>6:1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men: 6:2 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</p>
<p>6:3 If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.</p>
<p>6:4 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.</p>
<p>6:5 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other.</p>
<p>6:6 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place? 6:7 All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.</p>
<p>6:8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living? 6:9 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>6:10 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.</p>
<p>6:11 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better? 6:12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? 7:1 A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</p>
<p>7:2 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.</p>
<p>7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</p>
<p>7:4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</p>
<p>7:5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</p>
<p>7:6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.</p>
<p>7:7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</p>
<p>7:8 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</p>
<p>7:9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</p>
<p>7:10 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.</p>
<p>7:11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.</p>
<p>7:12 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</p>
<p>7:13 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked? 7:14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</p>
<p>7:15 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.</p>
<p>7:16 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ? 7:17 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? 7:18 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</p>
<p>7:19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.</p>
<p>7:20 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</p>
<p>7:21 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: 7:22 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</p>
<p>7:23 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</p>
<p>7:24 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? 7:25 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness: 7:26 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</p>
<p>7:27 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account: 7:28 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</p>
<p>7:29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</p>
<p>8:1 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</p>
<p>8:2 I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.</p>
<p>8:3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</p>
<p>8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou? 8:5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.</p>
<p>8:6 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</p>
<p>8:7 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? 8:8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</p>
<p>8:9 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</p>
<p>8:10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</p>
<p>8:11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</p>
<p>8:12 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him: 8:13 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</p>
<p>8:14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</p>
<p>8:15 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</p>
<p>8:16 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) 8:17 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</p>
<p>9:1 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.</p>
<p>9:2 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</p>
<p>9:3 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</p>
<p>9:4 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</p>
<p>9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</p>
<p>9:6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</p>
<p>9:7 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.</p>
<p>9:8 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.</p>
<p>9:9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.</p>
<p>9:10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</p>
<p>9:11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</p>
<p>9:12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.</p>
<p>9:13 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me: 9:14 There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it: 9:15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.</p>
<p>9:16 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</p>
<p>9:17 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</p>
<p>9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.</p>
<p>10:1 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.</p>
<p>10:2 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.</p>
<p>10:3 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.</p>
<p>10:4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</p>
<p>10:5 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: 10:6 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</p>
<p>10:7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</p>
<p>10:8 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</p>
<p>10:9 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</p>
<p>10:10 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</p>
<p>10:11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</p>
<p>10:12 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</p>
<p>10:13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</p>
<p>10:14 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? 10:15 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</p>
<p>10:16 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! 10:17 Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! 10:18 By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</p>
<p>10:19 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.</p>
<p>10:20 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</p>
<p>11:1 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.</p>
<p>11:2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</p>
<p>11:3 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.</p>
<p>11:4 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.</p>
<p>11:5 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.</p>
<p>11:6 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.</p>
<p>11:7 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun: 11:8 But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.</p>
<p>11:9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.</p>
<p>11:10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.</p>
<p>12:1 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; 12:2 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: 12:3 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, 12:4 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low; 12:5 Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: 12:6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.</p>
<p>12:7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.</p>
<p>12:8 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.</p>
<p>12:9 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</p>
<p>12:10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.</p>
<p>12:11 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.</p>
<p>12:12 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</p>
<p>12:13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</p>
<p>12:14 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00023"><a id="The_Song_of_Solomon"/>The Song of Solomon</h3>
<p>1:1 The song of songs, which is Solomon's.</p>
<p>1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.</p>
<p>1:3 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</p>
<p>1:4 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.</p>
<p>1:5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>
<p>1:6 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.</p>
<p>1:7 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? 1:8 If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</p>
<p>1:9 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.</p>
<p>1:10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.</p>
<p>1:11 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.</p>
<p>1:12 While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.</p>
<p>1:13 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.</p>
<p>1:14 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.</p>
<p>1:15 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.</p>
<p>1:16 Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.</p>
<p>1:17 The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.</p>
<p>2:1 I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.</p>
<p>2:2 As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</p>
<p>2:3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</p>
<p>2:4 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.</p>
<p>2:5 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</p>
<p>2:6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.</p>
<p>2:7 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.</p>
<p>2:8 The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</p>
<p>2:9 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.</p>
<p>2:10 My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>
<p>2:11 For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; 2:12 The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 2:13 The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>
<p>2:14 O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</p>
<p>2:15 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.</p>
<p>2:16 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.</p>
<p>2:17 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</p>
<p>3:1 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</p>
<p>3:2 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</p>
<p>3:3 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth? 3:4 It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</p>
<p>3:5 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.</p>
<p>3:6 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant? 3:7 Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.</p>
<p>3:8 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.</p>
<p>3:9 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.</p>
<p>3:10 He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>3:11 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.</p>
<p>4:1 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.</p>
<p>4:2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.</p>
<p>4:3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</p>
<p>4:4 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</p>
<p>4:5 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.</p>
<p>4:6 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</p>
<p>4:7 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.</p>
<p>4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</p>
<p>4:9 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</p>
<p>4:10 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices! 4:11 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</p>
<p>4:12 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</p>
<p>4:13 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard, 4:14 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: 4:15 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.</p>
<p>4:16 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</p>
<p>5:1 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</p>
<p>5:2 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</p>
<p>5:3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? 5:4 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.</p>
<p>5:5 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.</p>
<p>5:6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</p>
<p>5:7 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</p>
<p>5:8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.</p>
<p>5:9 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us? 5:10 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.</p>
<p>5:11 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.</p>
<p>5:12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.</p>
<p>5:13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.</p>
<p>5:14 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.</p>
<p>5:15 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</p>
<p>5:16 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>6:1 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.</p>
<p>6:2 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</p>
<p>6:3 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.</p>
<p>6:4 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.</p>
<p>6:5 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.</p>
<p>6:6 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.</p>
<p>6:7 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.</p>
<p>6:8 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.</p>
<p>6:9 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</p>
<p>6:10 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners? 6:11 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.</p>
<p>6:12 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.</p>
<p>6:13 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.</p>
<p>7:1 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</p>
<p>7:2 Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</p>
<p>7:3 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.</p>
<p>7:4 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.</p>
<p>7:5 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.</p>
<p>7:6 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! 7:7 This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.</p>
<p>7:8 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; 7:9 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</p>
<p>7:10 I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.</p>
<p>7:11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</p>
<p>7:12 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.</p>
<p>7:13 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</p>
<p>8:1 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.</p>
<p>8:2 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</p>
<p>8:3 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</p>
<p>8:4 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.</p>
<p>8:5 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.</p>
<p>8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.</p>
<p>8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</p>
<p>8:8 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? 8:9 If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.</p>
<p>8:10 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.</p>
<p>8:11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.</p>
<p>8:12 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</p>
<p>8:13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.</p>
<p>8:14 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</p>

<p>1:1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>
<p>1:2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</p>
<p>1:3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</p>
<p>1:4 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</p>
<p>1:5 Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</p>
<p>1:6 From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</p>
<p>1:7 Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</p>
<p>1:8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</p>
<p>1:9 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</p>
<p>1:10 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</p>
<p>1:11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</p>
<p>1:12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? 1:13 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</p>
<p>1:14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.</p>
<p>1:15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</p>
<p>1:16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; 1:17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p>
<p>1:18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>
<p>1:19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: 1:20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
<p>1:21 How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</p>
<p>1:22 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: 1:23 Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</p>
<p>1:24 Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies: 1:25 And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin: 1:26 And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</p>
<p>1:27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</p>
<p>1:28 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</p>
<p>1:29 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</p>
<p>1:30 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</p>
<p>1:31 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</p>
<p>2:1 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>2:2 And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</p>
<p>2:3 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>2:4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p>
<p>2:5 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.</p>
<p>2:6 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</p>
<p>2:7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots: 2:8 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made: 2:9 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.</p>
<p>2:10 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.</p>
<p>2:11 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</p>
<p>2:12 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low: 2:13 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, 2:14 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up, 2:15 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, 2:16 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.</p>
<p>2:17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</p>
<p>2:18 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.</p>
<p>2:19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</p>
<p>2:20 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; 2:21 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</p>
<p>2:22 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of ? 3:1 For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.</p>
<p>3:2 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, 3:3 The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.</p>
<p>3:4 And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</p>
<p>3:5 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</p>
<p>3:6 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand: 3:7 In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.</p>
<p>3:8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</p>
<p>3:9 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.</p>
<p>3:10 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</p>
<p>3:11 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.</p>
<p>3:12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</p>
<p>3:13 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.</p>
<p>3:14 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.</p>
<p>3:15 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</p>
<p>3:16 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: 3:17 Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.</p>
<p>3:18 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, 3:19 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, 3:20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, 3:21 The rings, and nose jewels, 3:22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, 3:23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.</p>
<p>3:24 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.</p>
<p>3:25 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</p>
<p>3:26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.</p>
<p>4:1 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.</p>
<p>4:2 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.</p>
<p>4:3 And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem: 4:4 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</p>
<p>4:5 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.</p>
<p>4:6 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.</p>
<p>5:1 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: 5:2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</p>
<p>5:3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</p>
<p>5:4 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? 5:5 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down: 5:6 And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</p>
<p>5:7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</p>
<p>5:8 Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth! 5:9 In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.</p>
<p>5:10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.</p>
<p>5:11 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them! 5:12 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.</p>
