<body><p>119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.</p>
<p>119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.</p>
<p>119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.</p>
<p>119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.</p>
<p>119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.</p>
<p>119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.</p>
<p>119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.</p>
<p>119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.</p>
<p>119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</p>
<p>119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.</p>
<p>119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.</p>
<p>119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.</p>
<p>119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.</p>
<p>119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.</p>
<p>119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.</p>
<p>119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.</p>
<p>119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.</p>
<p>119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</p>
<p>119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.</p>
<p>119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.</p>
<p>119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.</p>
<p>119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.</p>
<p>119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.</p>
<p>119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.</p>
<p>119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.</p>
<p>119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.</p>
<p>119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.</p>
<p>119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.</p>
<p>119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.</p>
<p>119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.</p>
<p>119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.</p>
<p>119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p>119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.</p>
<p>119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.</p>
<p>119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.</p>
<p>119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.</p>
<p>119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight.</p>
<p>119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.</p>
<p>119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.</p>
<p>120:1 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.</p>
<p>120:2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.</p>
<p>120:3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?</p>
<p>120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.</p>
<p>120:5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!</p>
<p>120:6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.</p>
<p>120:7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.</p>
<p>121:1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.</p>
<p>121:2 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>121:3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.</p>
<p>121:4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.</p>
<p>121:5 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.</p>
<p>121:6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.</p>
<p>121:7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.</p>
<p>121:8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.</p>
<p>122:1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>122:2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.</p>
<p>122:3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:</p>
<p>122:4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>122:5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.</p>
<p>122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.</p>
<p>122:7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.</p>
<p>122:8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.</p>
<p>122:9 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.</p>
<p>123:1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.</p>
<p>123:2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.</p>
<p>123:3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.</p>
<p>123:4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.</p>
<p>124:1 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;</p>
<p>124:2 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:</p>
<p>124:3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:</p>
<p>124:4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:</p>
<p>124:5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.</p>
<p>124:6 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.</p>
<p>124:7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.</p>
<p>124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>125:1 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</p>
<p>125:2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.</p>
<p>125:3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.</p>
<p>125:4 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.</p>
<p>125:5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.</p>
<p>126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.</p>
<p>126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.</p>
<p>126:3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.</p>
<p>126:4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.</p>
<p>126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</p>
<p>126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.</p>
<p>127:1 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.</p>
<p>127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.</p>
<p>127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.</p>
<p>127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.</p>
<p>127:5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.</p>
<p>128:1 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.</p>
<p>128:2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.</p>
<p>128:3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.</p>
<p>128:4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.</p>
<p>128:5 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.</p>
<p>128:6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.</p>
<p>129:1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:</p>
<p>129:2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.</p>
<p>129:3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.</p>
<p>129:4 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.</p>
<p>129:5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.</p>
<p>129:6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:</p>
<p>129:7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.</p>
<p>129:8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>130:1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.</p>
<p>130:2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.</p>
<p>130:3 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?</p>
<p>130:4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</p>
<p>130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.</p>
<p>130:6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.</p>
<p>130:7 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.</p>
<p>130:8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.</p>
<p>131:1 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.</p>
<p>131:2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.</p>
<p>131:3 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.</p>
<p>132:1 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:</p>
<p>132:2 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;</p>
<p>132:3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;</p>
<p>132:4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,</p>
<p>132:5 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.</p>
<p>132:6 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.</p>
<p>132:7 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.</p>
<p>132:8 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.</p>
<p>132:9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.</p>
<p>132:10 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</p>
<p>132:11 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.</p>
<p>132:12 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.</p>
<p>132:13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.</p>
<p>132:14 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.</p>
<p>132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p>
<p>132:16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</p>
<p>132:17 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</p>
<p>132:18 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.</p>
<p>133:1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</p>
<p>133:2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;</p>
<p>133:3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.</p>
<p>134:1 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>134:2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.</p>
<p>134:3 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.</p>
<p>135:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.</p>
<p>135:2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.</p>
<p>135:3 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.</p>
<p>135:4 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.</p>
<p>135:5 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.</p>
<p>135:6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.</p>
<p>135:7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.</p>
<p>135:8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.</p>
<p>135:9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.</p>
<p>135:10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;</p>
<p>135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:</p>
<p>135:12 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.</p>
<p>135:13 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.</p>
<p>135:14 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.</p>
<p>135:15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.</p>
<p>135:16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;</p>
<p>135:17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.</p>
<p>135:18 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.</p>
<p>135:19 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:</p>
<p>135:20 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.</p>
<p>135:21 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>136:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:2 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:3 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:4 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:5 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:6 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:7 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:8 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:9 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:10 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:11 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:12 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:13 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:14 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:15 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:16 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:17 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:18 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:19 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:20 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:21 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:22 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:23 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
<p>136:24 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:25 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>136:26 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>137:1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.</p>
<p>137:2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</p>
<p>137:3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.</p>
<p>137:4 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?</p>
<p>137:5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.</p>
<p>137:6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.</p>
<p>137:7 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.</p>
<p>137:8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.</p>
<p>137:9 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.</p>
<p>138:1 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.</p>
<p>138:2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.</p>
<p>138:3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.</p>
<p>138:4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p>138:5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD.</p>
<p>138:6 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.</p>
<p>138:7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.</p>
<p>138:8 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.</p>
<p>139:1 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.</p>
<p>139:2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.</p>
<p>139:3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</p>
<p>139:4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</p>
<p>139:5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.</p>
<p>139:6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</p>
<p>139:7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</p>
<p>139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.</p>
<p>139:9 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</p>
<p>139:10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</p>
<p>139:11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.</p>
<p>139:12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.</p>
<p>139:13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.</p>
<p>139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.</p>
<p>139:15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</p>
<p>139:16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.</p>
<p>139:17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!</p>
<p>139:18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.</p>
<p>139:19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.</p>
<p>139:20 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.</p>
<p>139:21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</p>
<p>139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</p>
<p>139:23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:</p>
<p>139:24 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</p>
<p>140:1 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;</p>
<p>140:2 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.</p>
<p>140:3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.</p>
<p>140:4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.</p>
<p>140:5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.</p>
<p>140:6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.</p>
<p>140:7 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.</p>
<p>140:8 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.</p>
<p>140:9 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</p>
<p>140:10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.</p>
<p>140:11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</p>
<p>140:12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.</p>
<p>140:13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.</p>
<p>141:1 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.</p>
<p>141:2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.</p>
<p>141:3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.</p>
<p>141:4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.</p>
<p>141:5 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.</p>
<p>141:6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.</p>
<p>141:7 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.</p>
<p>141:8 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.</p>
<p>141:9 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p>141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.</p>
<p>142:1 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.</p>
<p>142:2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.</p>
<p>142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path.</p>
<p>In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.</p>
<p>142:4 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.</p>
<p>142:5 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.</p>
<p>142:6 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.</p>
<p>142:7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.</p>
<p>143:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.</p>
<p>143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.</p>
<p>143:3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.</p>
<p>143:4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.</p>
<p>143:5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.</p>
<p>143:6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.</p>
<p>143:7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.</p>
<p>143:8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.</p>
<p>143:9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.</p>
<p>143:10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.</p>
<p>143:11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.</p>
<p>143:12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.</p>
<p>144:1 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:</p>
<p>144:2 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.</p>
<p>144:3 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!</p>
<p>144:4 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.</p>
<p>144:5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</p>
<p>144:6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.</p>
<p>144:7 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;</p>
<p>144:8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</p>
<p>144:9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.</p>
<p>144:10 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.</p>
<p>144:11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:</p>
<p>144:12 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:</p>
<p>144:13 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:</p>
<p>144:14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.</p>
<p>144:15 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.</p>
<p>145:1 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.</p>
<p>145:2 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.</p>
<p>145:3 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.</p>
<p>145:4 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.</p>
<p>145:5 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.</p>
<p>145:6 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.</p>
<p>145:7 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.</p>
<p>145:8 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.</p>
<p>145:9 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.</p>
<p>145:10 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.</p>
<p>145:11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;</p>
<p>145:12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.</p>
<p>145:13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.</p>
<p>145:14 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.</p>
<p>145:15 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.</p>
<p>145:16 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.</p>
<p>145:17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</p>
<p>145:18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.</p>
<p>145:19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.</p>
<p>145:20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.</p>
<p>145:21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.</p>
<p>146:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.</p>
<p>146:2 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.</p>
<p>146:3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.</p>
<p>146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.</p>
<p>146:5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:</p>
<p>146:6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:</p>
<p>146:7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:</p>
<p>146:8 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:</p>
<p>146:9 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.</p>
<p>146:10 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>147:1 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.</p>
<p>147:2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.</p>
<p>147:3 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.</p>
<p>147:4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.</p>
<p>147:5 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.</p>
<p>147:6 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.</p>
<p>147:7 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:</p>
<p>147:8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.</p>
<p>147:9 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.</p>
<p>147:10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.</p>
<p>147:11 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.</p>
<p>147:12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.</p>
<p>147:13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.</p>
<p>147:14 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.</p>
<p>147:15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.</p>
<p>147:16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.</p>
<p>147:17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?</p>
<p>147:18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.</p>
<p>147:19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.</p>
<p>147:20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>148:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.</p>
<p>148:2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.</p>
<p>148:3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.</p>
<p>148:4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.</p>
<p>148:5 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.</p>
<p>148:6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.</p>
<p>148:7 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:</p>
<p>148:8 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word:</p>
<p>148:9 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:</p>
<p>148:10 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:</p>
<p>148:11 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:</p>
<p>148:12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:</p>
<p>148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.</p>
<p>148:14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>149:1 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.</p>
<p>149:2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.</p>
<p>149:3 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.</p>
<p>149:4 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.</p>
<p>149:5 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.</p>
<p>149:6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand;</p>
<p>149:7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people;</p>
<p>149:8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;</p>
<p>149:9 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>150:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.</p>
<p>150:2 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.</p>
<p>150:3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.</p>
<p>150:4 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.</p>
<p>150:5 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.</p>
<p>150:6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00021"><a id="The_Proverbs"/>The Proverbs</h3>
<p>1:1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 1:2 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; 1:3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; 1:4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p>1:5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 1:6 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>
<p>1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p>1:8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 1:9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</p>
<p>1:10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</p>
<p>1:11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: 1:12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: 1:13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: 1:14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: 1:15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: 1:16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p>1:17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</p>
<p>1:18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.</p>
<p>1:19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>
<p>1:20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: 1:21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, 1:22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 1:23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>
<p>1:24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; 1:25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: 1:26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 1:27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</p>
<p>1:28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: 1:29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 1:30 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</p>
<p>1:31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p>1:32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>
<p>1:33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</p>
<p>2:1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; 2:2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; 2:3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; 2:4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; 2:5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p>2:6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>2:7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</p>
<p>2:8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</p>
<p>2:9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.</p>
<p>2:10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; 2:11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: 2:12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; 2:13 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 2:14 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 2:15 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths: 2:16 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; 2:17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</p>
<p>2:18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</p>
<p>2:19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</p>
<p>2:20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p>2:21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</p>
<p>2:22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</p>
<p>3:1 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: 3:2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</p>
<p>3:3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: 3:4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p>
<p>3:5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>
<p>3:6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</p>
<p>3:7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</p>
<p>3:8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</p>
<p>3:9 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: 3:10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</p>
<p>3:11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: 3:12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</p>
<p>3:13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</p>
<p>3:14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</p>
<p>3:15 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</p>
<p>3:16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.</p>
<p>3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</p>
<p>3:18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.</p>
<p>3:19 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</p>
<p>3:20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>
<p>3:21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: 3:22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p>
<p>3:23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</p>
<p>3:24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p>
<p>3:25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</p>
<p>3:26 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</p>
<p>3:27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</p>
<p>3:28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</p>
<p>3:29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</p>
<p>3:30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</p>
<p>3:31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</p>
<p>3:32 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.</p>
<p>3:33 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</p>
<p>3:34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</p>
<p>3:35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</p>
<p>4:1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</p>
<p>4:2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</p>
<p>4:3 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</p>
<p>4:4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</p>
<p>4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p>4:6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</p>
<p>4:7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</p>
<p>4:8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</p>
<p>4:9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</p>
<p>4:10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</p>
<p>4:11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</p>
<p>4:12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</p>
<p>4:13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.</p>
<p>4:14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.</p>
<p>4:15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</p>
<p>4:16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</p>
<p>4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p>4:18 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</p>
<p>4:19 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</p>
<p>4:20 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</p>
<p>4:21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</p>
<p>4:22 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</p>
<p>4:23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.</p>
<p>4:24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</p>
<p>4:25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</p>
<p>4:26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</p>
<p>4:27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</p>
<p>5:1 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding: 5:2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</p>
<p>5:3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: 5:4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p>5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</p>
<p>5:6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.</p>
<p>5:7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p>5:8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: 5:9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: 5:10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; 5:11 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, 5:12 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 5:13 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! 5:14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</p>
<p>5:15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</p>
<p>5:16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</p>
<p>5:17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</p>
<p>5:18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</p>
<p>5:19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</p>
<p>5:20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 5:21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</p>
<p>5:22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</p>
<p>5:23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
<p>6:1 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, 6:2 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p>6:3 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</p>
<p>6:4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</p>
<p>6:5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p>6:6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 6:7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 6:8 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>
<p>6:9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? 6:10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: 6:11 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p>6:12 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</p>
<p>6:13 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; 6:14 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</p>
<p>6:15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</p>
<p>6:16 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: 6:17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 6:18 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 6:19 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
<p>6:20 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 6:21 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.</p>
<p>6:22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>
<p>6:23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: 6:24 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>
<p>6:25 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p>6:26 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.</p>
<p>6:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 6:28 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? 6:29 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</p>
<p>6:30 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; 6:31 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
<p>6:32 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</p>
<p>6:33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
<p>6:34 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p>6:35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</p>
<p>7:1 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</p>
<p>7:2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</p>
<p>7:3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</p>
<p>7:4 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman: 7:5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</p>
<p>7:6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, 7:7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, 7:8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, 7:9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: 7:10 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</p>
<p>7:11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 7:12 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) 7:13 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, 7:14 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</p>
<p>7:15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</p>
<p>7:16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.</p>
<p>7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p>7:18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</p>
<p>7:19 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: 7:20 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.</p>
<p>7:21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</p>
<p>7:22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; 7:23 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</p>
<p>7:24 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p>7:25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</p>
<p>7:26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.</p>
<p>7:27 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</p>
<p>8:1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? 8:2 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</p>
<p>8:3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</p>
<p>8:4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.</p>
<p>8:5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</p>
<p>8:6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</p>
<p>8:7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p>8:8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.</p>
<p>8:9 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</p>
<p>8:10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>
<p>8:11 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</p>
<p>8:12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.</p>
<p>8:13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</p>
<p>8:14 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.</p>
<p>8:15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</p>
<p>8:16 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</p>
<p>8:17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</p>
<p>8:18 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.</p>
<p>8:19 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</p>
<p>8:20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: 8:21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</p>
<p>8:22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>
<p>8:23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</p>
<p>8:24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.</p>
<p>8:25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: 8:26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</p>
<p>8:27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: 8:28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: 8:29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: 8:30 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; 8:31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.</p>
<p>8:32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.</p>
<p>8:33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p>8:34 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p>8:35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</p>
<p>8:36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</p>
<p>9:1 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: 9:2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</p>
<p>9:3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, 9:4 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 9:5 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</p>
<p>9:6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</p>
<p>9:7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.</p>
<p>9:8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</p>
<p>9:9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</p>
<p>9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</p>
<p>9:11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</p>
<p>9:12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</p>
<p>9:13 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.</p>
