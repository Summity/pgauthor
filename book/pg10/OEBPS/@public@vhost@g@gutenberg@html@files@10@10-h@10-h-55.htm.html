<body><p>6:26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</p>
<p>6:27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.</p>
<p>6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.</p>
<p>6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.</p>
<p>6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.</p>
<p>6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.</p>
<p>6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.</p>
<p>6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.</p>
<p>6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.</p>
<p>6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</p>
<p>6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</p>
<p>6:39 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch? 6:40 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.</p>
<p>6:41 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 6:42 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</p>
<p>6:43 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</p>
<p>6:44 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</p>
<p>6:45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.</p>
<p>6:46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? 6:47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like: 6:48 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</p>
<p>6:49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</p>
<p>7:1 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</p>
<p>7:2 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</p>
<p>7:3 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</p>
<p>7:4 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: 7:5 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p>
<p>7:6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: 7:7 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p>
<p>7:8 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</p>
<p>7:9 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p>
<p>7:10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p>
<p>7:11 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</p>
<p>7:12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</p>
<p>7:13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</p>
<p>7:14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still.</p>
<p>And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p>
<p>7:15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</p>
<p>7:16 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</p>
<p>7:17 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</p>
<p>7:18 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p>
<p>7:19 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 7:20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 7:21 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</p>
<p>7:22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</p>
<p>7:23 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
<p>7:24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? 7:25 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.</p>
<p>7:26 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</p>
<p>7:27 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p>7:28 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>
<p>7:29 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</p>
<p>7:30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</p>
<p>7:31 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? 7:32 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</p>
<p>7:33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</p>
<p>7:34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! 7:35 But wisdom is justified of all her children.</p>
<p>7:36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</p>
<p>7:37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, 7:38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</p>
<p>7:39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</p>
<p>7:40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>
<p>7:41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>
<p>7:42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? 7:43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>
<p>7:44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</p>
<p>7:45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>
<p>7:46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p>
<p>7:47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.</p>
<p>7:48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>
<p>7:49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? 7:50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p>
<p>8:1 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him, 8:2 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, 8:3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.</p>
<p>8:4 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable: 8:5 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</p>
<p>8:6 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</p>
<p>8:7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</p>
<p>8:8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>8:9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? 8:10 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</p>
<p>8:11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</p>
<p>8:12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</p>
<p>8:13 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</p>
<p>8:14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</p>
<p>8:15 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
<p>8:16 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</p>
<p>8:17 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</p>
<p>8:18 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.</p>
<p>8:19 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.</p>
<p>8:20 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</p>
<p>8:21 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</p>
<p>8:22 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</p>
<p>8:23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.</p>
<p>8:24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</p>
<p>8:25 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.</p>
<p>8:26 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</p>
<p>8:27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.</p>
<p>8:28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</p>
<p>8:29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.) 8:30 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</p>
<p>8:31 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.</p>
<p>8:32 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</p>
<p>8:33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</p>
<p>8:34 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</p>
<p>8:35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</p>
<p>8:36 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.</p>
<p>8:37 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</p>
<p>8:38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, 8:39 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</p>
<p>8:40 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</p>
<p>8:41 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house: 8:42 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</p>
<p>8:43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, 8:44 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.</p>
<p>8:45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 8:46 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</p>
<p>8:47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</p>
<p>8:48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.</p>
<p>8:49 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.</p>
<p>8:50 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.</p>
<p>8:51 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.</p>
<p>8:52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</p>
<p>8:53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</p>
<p>8:54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.</p>
<p>8:55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.</p>
<p>8:56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.</p>
<p>9:1 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.</p>
<p>9:2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</p>
<p>9:3 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.</p>
<p>9:4 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.</p>
<p>9:5 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</p>
<p>9:6 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.</p>
<p>9:7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead; 9:8 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</p>
<p>9:9 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</p>
<p>9:10 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</p>
<p>9:11 And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.</p>
<p>9:12 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</p>
<p>9:13 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</p>
<p>9:14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</p>
<p>9:15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.</p>
<p>9:16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</p>
<p>9:17 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</p>
<p>9:18 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am? 9:19 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</p>
<p>9:20 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</p>
<p>9:21 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing; 9:22 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</p>
<p>9:23 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</p>
<p>9:24 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</p>
<p>9:25 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away? 9:26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.</p>
<p>9:27 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>9:28 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</p>
<p>9:29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.</p>
<p>9:30 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: 9:31 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>9:32 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</p>
<p>9:33 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</p>
<p>9:34 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</p>
<p>9:35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</p>
<p>9:36 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</p>
<p>9:37 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</p>
<p>9:38 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</p>
<p>9:39 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</p>
<p>9:40 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</p>
<p>9:41 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</p>
<p>9:42 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him.</p>
<p>And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</p>
<p>9:43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples, 9:44 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</p>
<p>9:45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</p>
<p>9:46 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</p>
<p>9:47 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him, 9:48 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</p>
<p>9:49 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</p>
<p>9:50 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.</p>
<p>9:51 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 9:52 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</p>
<p>9:53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>9:54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? 9:55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</p>
<p>9:56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</p>
<p>9:57 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>
<p>9:58 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</p>
<p>9:59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</p>
<p>9:60 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>9:61 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</p>
<p>9:62 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>10:1 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.</p>
<p>10:2 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.</p>
<p>10:3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.</p>
<p>10:4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.</p>
<p>10:5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.</p>
<p>10:6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.</p>
<p>10:7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.</p>
<p>10:8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: 10:9 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</p>
<p>10:10 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, 10:11 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</p>
<p>10:12 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.</p>
<p>10:13 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
<p>10:14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.</p>
<p>10:15 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.</p>
<p>10:16 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</p>
<p>10:17 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.</p>
<p>10:18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.</p>
<p>10:19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</p>
<p>10:20 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.</p>
<p>10:21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</p>
<p>10:22 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</p>
<p>10:23 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: 10:24 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p>
<p>10:25 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 10:26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? 10:27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
<p>10:28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</p>
<p>10:29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? 10:30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</p>
<p>10:31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</p>
<p>10:32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</p>
<p>10:33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, 10:34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</p>
<p>10:35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</p>
<p>10:36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? 10:37 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</p>
<p>10:38 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.</p>
<p>10:39 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.</p>
<p>10:40 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</p>
<p>10:41 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: 10:42 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</p>
<p>11:1 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</p>
<p>11:2 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.</p>
<p>11:3 Give us day by day our daily bread.</p>
<p>11:4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.</p>
<p>11:5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; 11:6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him? 11:7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.</p>
<p>11:8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.</p>
<p>11:9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</p>
<p>11:10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</p>
<p>11:11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? 11:12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? 11:13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? 11:14 And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.</p>
<p>11:15 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.</p>
<p>11:16 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.</p>
<p>11:17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.</p>
<p>11:18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.</p>
<p>11:19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.</p>
<p>11:20 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.</p>
<p>11:21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace: 11:22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.</p>
<p>11:23 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.</p>
<p>11:24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.</p>
<p>11:25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.</p>
<p>11:26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.</p>
<p>11:27 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.</p>
<p>11:28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.</p>
<p>11:29 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.</p>
<p>11:30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.</p>
<p>11:31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</p>
<p>11:32 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</p>
<p>11:33 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.</p>
<p>11:34 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.</p>
<p>11:35 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.</p>
<p>11:36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.</p>
<p>11:37 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</p>
<p>11:38 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.</p>
<p>11:39 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.</p>
<p>11:40 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also? 11:41 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.</p>
<p>11:42 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</p>
<p>11:43 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</p>
<p>11:44 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.</p>
<p>11:45 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.</p>
<p>11:46 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</p>
<p>11:47 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</p>
<p>11:48 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</p>
<p>11:49 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute: 11:50 That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; 11:51 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.</p>
<p>11:52 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</p>
<p>11:53 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things: 11:54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</p>
<p>12:1 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</p>
<p>12:2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.</p>
<p>12:3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.</p>
<p>12:4 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.</p>
<p>12:5 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.</p>
<p>12:6 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? 12:7 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>
<p>12:8 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: 12:9 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.</p>
<p>12:10 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.</p>
<p>12:11 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: 12:12 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.</p>
<p>12:13 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</p>
<p>12:14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? 12:15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</p>
<p>12:16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: 12:17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? 12:18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.</p>
<p>12:19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</p>
<p>12:20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? 12:21 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</p>
<p>12:22 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.</p>
<p>12:23 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.</p>
<p>12:24 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls? 12:25 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? 12:26 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest? 12:27 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</p>
<p>12:28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith? 12:29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.</p>
<p>12:30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.</p>
<p>12:31 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>
<p>12:32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</p>
<p>12:33 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.</p>
<p>12:34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>
<p>12:35 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; 12:36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</p>
<p>12:37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.</p>
<p>12:38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.</p>
<p>12:39 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.</p>
<p>12:40 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.</p>
<p>12:41 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all? 12:42 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season? 12:43 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.</p>
<p>12:44 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.</p>
<p>12:45 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; 12:46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</p>
<p>12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</p>
<p>12:48 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.</p>
<p>12:49 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled? 12:50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished! 12:51 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: 12:52 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.</p>
<p>12:53 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</p>
<p>12:54 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.</p>
<p>12:55 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.</p>
<p>12:56 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time? 12:57 Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right? 12:58 When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.</p>
<p>12:59 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.</p>
<p>13:1 There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.</p>
<p>13:2 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things? 13:3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</p>
<p>13:4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? 13:5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</p>
<p>13:6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.</p>
<p>13:7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 13:8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 13:9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.</p>
<p>13:10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.</p>
<p>13:11 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.</p>
<p>13:12 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.</p>
<p>13:13 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.</p>
<p>13:14 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.</p>
<p>13:15 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? 13:16 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? 13:17 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</p>
<p>13:18 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it? 13:19 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.</p>
<p>13:20 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? 13:21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
<p>13:22 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.</p>
<p>13:23 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, 13:24 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</p>
<p>13:25 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are: 13:26 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.</p>
<p>13:27 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</p>
<p>13:28 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.</p>
<p>13:29 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>13:30 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.</p>
<p>13:31 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.</p>
<p>13:32 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.</p>
<p>13:33 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>13:34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! 13:35 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>14:1 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.</p>
<p>14:2 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.</p>
<p>14:3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? 14:4 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; 14:5 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? 14:6 And they could not answer him again to these things.</p>
<p>14:7 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.</p>
<p>14:8 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; 14:9 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.</p>
<p>14:10 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.</p>
<p>14:11 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>
<p>14:12 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.</p>
<p>14:13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: 14:14 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.</p>
<p>14:15 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>14:16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: 14:17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.</p>
<p>14:18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.</p>
<p>14:19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.</p>
<p>14:20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</p>
<p>14:21 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.</p>
<p>14:22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.</p>
<p>14:23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</p>
<p>14:24 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.</p>
<p>14:25 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them, 14:26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.</p>
<p>14:27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.</p>
<p>14:28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? 14:29 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, 14:30 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</p>
<p>14:31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? 14:32 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.</p>
<p>14:33 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.</p>
<p>14:34 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? 14:35 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>15:1 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.</p>
<p>15:2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</p>
<p>15:3 And he spake this parable unto them, saying, 15:4 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? 15:5 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</p>
<p>15:6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.</p>
<p>15:7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.</p>
<p>15:8 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it? 15:9 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.</p>
<p>15:10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</p>
<p>15:11 And he said, A certain man had two sons: 15:12 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.</p>
<p>15:13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.</p>
<p>15:14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.</p>
<p>15:15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</p>
<p>15:16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.</p>
<p>15:17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! 15:18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, 15:19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</p>
<p>15:20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</p>
<p>15:21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</p>
<p>15:22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: 15:23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: 15:24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</p>
<p>15:25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.</p>
<p>15:26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</p>
<p>15:27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.</p>
<p>15:28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.</p>
<p>15:29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: 15:30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</p>
<p>15:31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</p>
<p>15:32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</p>
<p>16:1 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</p>
<p>16:2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</p>
<p>16:3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</p>
<p>16:4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</p>
<p>16:5 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? 16:6 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</p>
<p>16:7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</p>
<p>16:8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</p>
<p>16:9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</p>
<p>16:10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</p>
<p>16:11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? 16:12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? 16:13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>
<p>16:14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</p>
<p>16:15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</p>
<p>16:16 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</p>
<p>16:17 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.</p>
<p>16:18 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.</p>
<p>16:19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: 16:20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, 16:21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</p>
<p>16:22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; 16:23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</p>
<p>16:24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</p>
<p>16:25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</p>
<p>16:26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</p>
<p>16:27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: 16:28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</p>
<p>16:29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</p>
<p>16:30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>
<p>16:31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</p>
<p>17:1 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! 17:2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</p>
<p>17:3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</p>
<p>17:4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.</p>
<p>17:5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.</p>
<p>17:6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.</p>
<p>17:7 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? 17:8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? 17:9 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</p>
<p>17:10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</p>
<p>17:11 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</p>
<p>17:12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: 17:13 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</p>
<p>17:14 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</p>
<p>17:15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, 17:16 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</p>
