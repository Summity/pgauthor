<body><p>11:5 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? 11:6 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.</p>
<p>11:7 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.</p>
<p>11:8 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.</p>
<p>11:9 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: 11:10 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p>11:11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.</p>
<p>11:12 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry: 11:13 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.</p>
<p>11:14 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.</p>
<p>11:15 And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves; 11:16 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.</p>
<p>11:17 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>
<p>11:18 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.</p>
<p>11:19 And when even was come, he went out of the city.</p>
<p>11:20 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</p>
<p>11:21 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.</p>
<p>11:22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</p>
<p>11:23 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.</p>
<p>11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</p>
<p>11:25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</p>
<p>11:26 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</p>
<p>11:27 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, 11:28 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things? 11:29 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
<p>11:30 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.</p>
<p>11:31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? 11:32 But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.</p>
<p>11:33 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
<p>12:1 And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</p>
<p>12:2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</p>
<p>12:3 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.</p>
<p>12:4 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.</p>
<p>12:5 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</p>
<p>12:6 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>
<p>12:7 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.</p>
<p>12:8 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</p>
<p>12:9 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</p>
<p>12:10 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner: 12:11 This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? 12:12 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</p>
<p>12:13 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.</p>
<p>12:14 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 12:15 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.</p>
<p>12:16 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.</p>
<p>12:17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.</p>
<p>12:18 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, 12:19 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
<p>12:20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</p>
<p>12:21 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</p>
<p>12:22 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</p>
<p>12:23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</p>
<p>12:24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? 12:25 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</p>
<p>12:26 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? 12:27 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</p>
<p>12:28 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? 12:29 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: 12:30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.</p>
<p>12:31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</p>
<p>12:32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: 12:33 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</p>
<p>12:34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.</p>
<p>12:35 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David? 12:36 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>
<p>12:37 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</p>
<p>12:38 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces, 12:39 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: 12:40 Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</p>
<p>12:41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</p>
<p>12:42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</p>
<p>12:43 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: 12:44 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</p>
<p>13:1 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here! 13:2 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</p>
<p>13:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 13:4 Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled? 13:5 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you: 13:6 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</p>
<p>13:7 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.</p>
<p>13:8 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.</p>
<p>13:9 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.</p>
<p>13:10 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.</p>
<p>13:11 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>13:12 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.</p>
<p>13:13 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</p>
<p>13:14 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains: 13:15 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house: 13:16 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.</p>
<p>13:17 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! 13:18 And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.</p>
<p>13:19 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.</p>
<p>13:20 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.</p>
<p>13:21 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not: 13:22 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.</p>
<p>13:23 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.</p>
<p>13:24 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, 13:25 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.</p>
<p>13:26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</p>
<p>13:27 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</p>
<p>13:28 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: 13:29 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.</p>
<p>13:30 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.</p>
<p>13:31 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</p>
<p>13:32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</p>
<p>13:33 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.</p>
<p>13:34 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.</p>
<p>13:35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: 13:36 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.</p>
<p>13:37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.</p>
<p>14:1 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.</p>
<p>14:2 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.</p>
<p>14:3 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.</p>
<p>14:4 And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? 14:5 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</p>
<p>14:6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.</p>
<p>14:7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</p>
<p>14:8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</p>
<p>14:9 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</p>
<p>14:10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.</p>
<p>14:11 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</p>
<p>14:12 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover? 14:13 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.</p>
<p>14:14 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? 14:15 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</p>
<p>14:16 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</p>
<p>14:17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.</p>
<p>14:18 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</p>
<p>14:19 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I? 14:20 And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</p>
<p>14:21 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.</p>
<p>14:22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</p>
<p>14:23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</p>
<p>14:24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</p>
<p>14:25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>14:26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
<p>14:27 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</p>
<p>14:28 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
<p>14:29 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.</p>
<p>14:30 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
<p>14:31 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</p>
<p>14:32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</p>
<p>14:33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; 14:34 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</p>
<p>14:35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</p>
<p>14:36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</p>
<p>14:37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? 14:38 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</p>
<p>14:39 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</p>
<p>14:40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</p>
<p>14:41 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p>14:42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</p>
<p>14:43 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</p>
<p>14:44 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.</p>
<p>14:45 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</p>
<p>14:46 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</p>
<p>14:47 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</p>
<p>14:48 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me? 14:49 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</p>
<p>14:50 And they all forsook him, and fled.</p>
<p>14:51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him: 14:52 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</p>
<p>14:53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</p>
<p>14:54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</p>
<p>14:55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</p>
<p>14:56 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</p>
<p>14:57 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, 14:58 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</p>
<p>14:59 But neither so did their witness agree together.</p>
<p>14:60 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 14:61 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? 14:62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p>14:63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses? 14:64 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</p>
<p>14:65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</p>
<p>14:66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest: 14:67 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>14:68 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</p>
<p>14:69 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</p>
<p>14:70 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</p>
<p>14:71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</p>
<p>14:72 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</p>
<p>15:1 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</p>
<p>15:2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.</p>
<p>15:3 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</p>
<p>15:4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</p>
<p>15:5 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</p>
<p>15:6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</p>
<p>15:7 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</p>
<p>15:8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</p>
<p>15:9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 15:10 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</p>
<p>15:11 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</p>
<p>15:12 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? 15:13 And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>
<p>15:14 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</p>
<p>15:15 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</p>
<p>15:16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</p>
<p>15:17 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head, 15:18 And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 15:19 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</p>
<p>15:20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</p>
<p>15:21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</p>
<p>15:22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</p>
<p>15:23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</p>
<p>15:24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</p>
<p>15:25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p>
<p>15:26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p>15:27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</p>
<p>15:28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</p>
<p>15:29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, 15:30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</p>
<p>15:31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>
<p>15:32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</p>
<p>15:33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</p>
<p>15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 15:35 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</p>
<p>15:36 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</p>
<p>15:37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</p>
<p>15:39 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</p>
<p>15:40 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; 15:41 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</p>
<p>15:42 And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, 15:43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</p>
<p>15:44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</p>
<p>15:45 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</p>
<p>15:46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</p>
<p>15:47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</p>
<p>16:1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.</p>
<p>16:2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</p>
<p>16:3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? 16:4 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</p>
<p>16:5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.</p>
<p>16:6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</p>
<p>16:7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</p>
<p>16:8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.</p>
<p>16:9 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</p>
<p>16:10 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</p>
<p>16:11 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</p>
<p>16:12 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</p>
<p>16:13 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.</p>
<p>16:14 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.</p>
<p>16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</p>
<p>16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</p>
<p>16:17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; 16:18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</p>
<p>16:19 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.</p>
<p>16:20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.</p>

<p>1:1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, 1:2 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; 1:3 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 1:4 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</p>
<p>1:5 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</p>
<p>1:6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</p>
<p>1:7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.</p>
<p>1:8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, 1:9 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</p>
<p>1:10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</p>
<p>1:11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</p>
<p>1:12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</p>
<p>1:13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</p>
<p>1:14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</p>
<p>1:15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</p>
<p>1:16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</p>
<p>1:17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</p>
<p>1:18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</p>
<p>1:19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</p>
<p>1:20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</p>
<p>1:21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</p>
<p>1:22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</p>
<p>1:23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</p>
<p>1:24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, 1:25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</p>
<p>1:26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 1:27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</p>
<p>1:28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</p>
<p>1:29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</p>
<p>1:30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</p>
<p>1:31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</p>
<p>1:32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 1:33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</p>
<p>1:34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 1:35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p>
<p>1:36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</p>
<p>1:37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p>
<p>1:38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p>
<p>1:39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; 1:40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</p>
<p>1:41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: 1:42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</p>
<p>1:43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 1:44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</p>
<p>1:45 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</p>
<p>1:46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 1:47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</p>
<p>1:48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</p>
<p>1:49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.</p>
<p>1:50 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</p>
<p>1:51 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</p>
<p>1:52 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</p>
<p>1:53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</p>
<p>1:54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; 1:55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</p>
<p>1:56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</p>
<p>1:57 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</p>
<p>1:58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</p>
<p>1:59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</p>
<p>1:60 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</p>
<p>1:61 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</p>
<p>1:62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</p>
<p>1:63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</p>
<p>1:64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.</p>
<p>1:65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</p>
<p>1:66 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>
<p>1:67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, 1:68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people, 1:69 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David; 1:70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began: 1:71 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; 1:72 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; 1:73 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, 1:74 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, 1:75 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</p>
<p>1:76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; 1:77 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins, 1:78 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us, 1:79 To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>
<p>1:80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</p>
<p>2:1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.</p>
<p>2:2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) 2:3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</p>
<p>2:4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) 2:5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</p>
<p>2:6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</p>
<p>2:7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</p>
<p>2:8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</p>
<p>2:9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</p>
<p>2:10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</p>
<p>2:11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</p>
<p>2:12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</p>
<p>2:13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, 2:14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</p>
<p>2:15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.</p>
<p>2:16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</p>
<p>2:17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</p>
<p>2:18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</p>
<p>2:19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</p>
<p>2:20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</p>
<p>2:21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>
<p>2:22 And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord; 2:23 (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) 2:24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</p>
<p>2:25 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.</p>
<p>2:26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</p>
<p>2:27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, 2:28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 2:29 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: 2:30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, 2:31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; 2:32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</p>
<p>2:33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</p>
<p>2:34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; 2:35 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</p>
<p>2:36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity; 2:37 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</p>
<p>2:38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>2:39 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</p>
<p>2:40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</p>
<p>2:41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</p>
<p>2:42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</p>
<p>2:43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.</p>
<p>2:44 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.</p>
<p>2:45 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</p>
<p>2:46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</p>
<p>2:47 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</p>
<p>2:48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</p>
<p>2:49 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? 2:50 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</p>
<p>2:51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</p>
<p>2:52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</p>
<p>3:1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, 3:2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</p>
<p>3:3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; 3:4 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
<p>3:5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; 3:6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</p>
<p>3:7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</p>
<p>3:9 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</p>
<p>3:10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? 3:11 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.</p>
<p>3:12 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? 3:13 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.</p>
<p>3:14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.</p>
<p>3:15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; 3:16 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire: 3:17 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.</p>
<p>3:18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.</p>
<p>3:19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, 3:20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.</p>
<p>3:21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, 3:22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.</p>
<p>3:23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli, 3:24 Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the son of Joseph, 3:25 Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Amos, which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was the son of Nagge, 3:26 Which was the son of Maath, which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Juda, 3:27 Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri, 3:28 Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er, 3:29 Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, 3:30 Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of Eliakim, 3:31 Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David, 3:32 Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was the son of Naasson, 3:33 Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son of Juda, 3:34 Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor, 3:35 Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala, 3:36 Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech, 3:37 Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the son of Cainan, 3:38 Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.</p>
<p>4:1 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 4:2 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.</p>
<p>4:3 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.</p>
<p>4:4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</p>
<p>4:5 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</p>
<p>4:6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.</p>
<p>4:7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.</p>
<p>4:8 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</p>
<p>4:9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: 4:10 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: 4:11 And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
<p>4:12 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</p>
<p>4:13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.</p>
<p>4:14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.</p>
<p>4:15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.</p>
<p>4:16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.</p>
<p>4:17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, 4:18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, 4:19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</p>
<p>4:20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.</p>
<p>4:21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.</p>
<p>4:22 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son? 4:23 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.</p>
<p>4:24 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.</p>
<p>4:25 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land; 4:26 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.</p>
<p>4:27 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.</p>
<p>4:28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, 4:29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.</p>
<p>4:30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way, 4:31 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.</p>
<p>4:32 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.</p>
<p>4:33 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, 4:34 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.</p>
<p>4:35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</p>
<p>And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.</p>
<p>4:36 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.</p>
<p>4:37 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.</p>
<p>4:38 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house.</p>
<p>And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.</p>
<p>4:39 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</p>
<p>4:40 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.</p>
<p>4:41 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</p>
<p>4:42 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.</p>
<p>4:43 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</p>
<p>4:44 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.</p>
<p>5:1 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, 5:2 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</p>
<p>5:3 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</p>
<p>5:4 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</p>
<p>5:5 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</p>
<p>5:6 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.</p>
<p>5:7 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</p>
<p>5:8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</p>
<p>5:9 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: 5:10 And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</p>
<p>5:11 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</p>
<p>5:12 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
<p>5:13 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</p>
<p>5:14 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>
<p>5:15 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</p>
<p>5:16 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</p>
<p>5:17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.</p>
<p>5:18 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</p>
<p>5:19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.</p>
<p>5:20 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</p>
<p>5:21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 5:22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? 5:23 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? 5:24 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</p>
<p>5:25 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</p>
<p>5:26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</p>
<p>5:27 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</p>
<p>5:28 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</p>
<p>5:29 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.</p>
<p>5:30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 5:31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.</p>
<p>5:32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>
<p>5:33 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink? 5:34 And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? 5:35 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</p>
<p>5:36 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.</p>
<p>5:37 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</p>
<p>5:38 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</p>
<p>5:39 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</p>
<p>6:1 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.</p>
<p>6:2 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days? 6:3 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; 6:4 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone? 6:5 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p>
<p>6:6 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.</p>
<p>6:7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.</p>
<p>6:8 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.</p>
<p>6:9 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it? 6:10 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</p>
<p>6:11 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</p>
<p>6:12 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</p>
<p>6:13 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; 6:14 Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, 6:15 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes, 6:16 And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.</p>
<p>6:17 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 6:18 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.</p>
<p>6:19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.</p>
<p>6:20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>6:21 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.</p>
<p>6:22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.</p>
<p>6:23 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.</p>
<p>6:24 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.</p>
<p>6:25 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</p>
