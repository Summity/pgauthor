<body><p>7:12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? 7:13 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints; 7:14 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: 7:15 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</p>
<p>7:16 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</p>
<p>7:17 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? 7:18 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment? 7:19 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? 7:20 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? 7:21 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</p>
<p>8:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 8:2 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? 8:3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 8:4 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; 8:5 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 8:6 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</p>
<p>8:7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</p>
<p>8:8 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 8:9 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) 8:10 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? 8:11 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? 8:12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</p>
<p>8:13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: 8:14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.</p>
<p>8:15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</p>
<p>8:16 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</p>
<p>8:17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.</p>
<p>8:18 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</p>
<p>8:19 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</p>
<p>8:20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers: 8:21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.</p>
<p>8:22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</p>
<p>9:1 Then Job answered and said, 9:2 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? 9:3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</p>
<p>9:4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? 9:5 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</p>
<p>9:6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</p>
<p>9:7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</p>
<p>9:8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</p>
<p>9:9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</p>
<p>9:10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</p>
<p>9:11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</p>
<p>9:12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? 9:13 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</p>
<p>9:14 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? 9:15 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</p>
<p>9:16 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</p>
<p>9:17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</p>
<p>9:18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</p>
<p>9:19 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? 9:20 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</p>
<p>9:21 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</p>
<p>9:22 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</p>
<p>9:23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</p>
<p>9:24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? 9:25 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</p>
<p>9:26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.</p>
<p>9:27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself: 9:28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</p>
<p>9:29 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? 9:30 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 9:31 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</p>
<p>9:32 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</p>
<p>9:33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</p>
<p>9:34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: 9:35 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</p>
<p>10:1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p>10:2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</p>
<p>10:3 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? 10:4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? 10:5 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days, 10:6 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? 10:7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.</p>
<p>10:8 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</p>
<p>10:9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? 10:10 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? 10:11 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</p>
<p>10:12 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</p>
<p>10:13 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.</p>
<p>10:14 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</p>
<p>10:15 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; 10:16 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</p>
<p>10:17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</p>
<p>10:18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! 10:19 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p>
<p>10:20 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, 10:21 Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; 10:22 A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</p>
<p>11:1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 11:2 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? 11:3 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? 11:4 For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</p>
<p>11:5 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 11:6 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</p>
<p>11:7 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 11:8 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? 11:9 The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</p>
<p>11:10 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? 11:11 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it? 11:12 For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.</p>
<p>11:13 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; 11:14 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</p>
<p>11:15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: 11:16 Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away: 11:17 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</p>
<p>11:18 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</p>
<p>11:19 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</p>
<p>11:20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.</p>
<p>12:1 And Job answered and said, 12:2 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</p>
<p>12:3 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? 12:4 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.</p>
<p>12:5 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</p>
<p>12:6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.</p>
<p>12:7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: 12:8 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</p>
<p>12:9 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this? 12:10 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</p>
<p>12:11 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? 12:12 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.</p>
<p>12:13 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</p>
<p>12:14 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</p>
<p>12:15 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</p>
<p>12:16 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.</p>
<p>12:17 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.</p>
<p>12:18 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.</p>
<p>12:19 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</p>
<p>12:20 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.</p>
<p>12:21 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.</p>
<p>12:22 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</p>
<p>12:23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.</p>
<p>12:24 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</p>
<p>12:25 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.</p>
<p>13:1 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.</p>
<p>13:2 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.</p>
<p>13:3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</p>
<p>13:4 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.</p>
<p>13:5 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</p>
<p>13:6 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</p>
<p>13:7 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? 13:8 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? 13:9 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him? 13:10 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.</p>
<p>13:11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you? 13:12 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.</p>
<p>13:13 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.</p>
<p>13:14 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? 13:15 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.</p>
<p>13:16 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.</p>
<p>13:17 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.</p>
<p>13:18 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.</p>
<p>13:19 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.</p>
<p>13:20 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.</p>
<p>13:21 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.</p>
<p>13:22 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.</p>
<p>13:23 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.</p>
<p>13:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? 13:25 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? 13:26 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.</p>
<p>13:27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.</p>
<p>13:28 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.</p>
<p>14:1 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.</p>
<p>14:2 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</p>
<p>14:3 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee? 14:4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</p>
<p>14:5 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 14:6 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</p>
<p>14:7 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</p>
<p>14:8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; 14:9 Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</p>
<p>14:10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? 14:11 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: 14:12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</p>
<p>14:13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! 14:14 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</p>
<p>14:15 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.</p>
<p>14:16 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin? 14:17 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.</p>
<p>14:18 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.</p>
<p>14:19 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</p>
<p>14:20 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</p>
<p>14:21 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</p>
<p>14:22 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</p>
<p>15:1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 15:2 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? 15:3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? 15:4 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</p>
<p>15:5 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</p>
<p>15:6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</p>
<p>15:7 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills? 15:8 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? 15:9 What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? 15:10 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</p>
<p>15:11 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? 15:12 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, 15:13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth? 15:14 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? 15:15 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</p>
<p>15:16 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? 15:17 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare; 15:18 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it: 15:19 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</p>
<p>15:20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</p>
<p>15:21 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</p>
<p>15:22 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</p>
<p>15:23 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p>15:24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p>
<p>15:25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</p>
<p>15:26 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: 15:27 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.</p>
<p>15:28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</p>
<p>15:29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</p>
<p>15:30 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</p>
<p>15:31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</p>
<p>15:32 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</p>
<p>15:33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</p>
<p>15:34 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</p>
<p>15:35 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</p>
<p>16:1 Then Job answered and said, 16:2 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.</p>
<p>16:3 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? 16:4 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</p>
<p>16:5 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.</p>
<p>16:6 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased? 16:7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</p>
<p>16:8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</p>
<p>16:9 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</p>
<p>16:10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</p>
<p>16:11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p>16:12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</p>
<p>16:13 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</p>
<p>16:14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</p>
<p>16:15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</p>
<p>16:16 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 16:17 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.</p>
<p>16:18 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</p>
<p>16:19 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.</p>
<p>16:20 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.</p>
<p>16:21 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour! 16:22 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</p>
<p>17:1 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.</p>
<p>17:2 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? 17:3 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me? 17:4 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.</p>
<p>17:5 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>
<p>17:6 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.</p>
<p>17:7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.</p>
<p>17:8 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.</p>
<p>17:9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>17:10 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.</p>
<p>17:11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.</p>
<p>17:12 They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.</p>
<p>17:13 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.</p>
<p>17:14 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.</p>
<p>17:15 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it? 17:16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.</p>
<p>18:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 18:2 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.</p>
<p>18:3 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight? 18:4 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place? 18:5 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</p>
<p>18:6 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.</p>
<p>18:7 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</p>
<p>18:8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.</p>
<p>18:9 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.</p>
<p>18:10 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</p>
<p>18:11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.</p>
<p>18:12 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.</p>
<p>18:13 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.</p>
<p>18:14 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</p>
<p>18:15 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</p>
<p>18:16 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.</p>
<p>18:17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</p>
<p>18:18 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</p>
<p>18:19 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.</p>
<p>18:20 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.</p>
<p>18:21 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.</p>
<p>19:1 Then Job answered and said, 19:2 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? 19:3 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.</p>
<p>19:4 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</p>
<p>19:5 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach: 19:6 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</p>
<p>19:7 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</p>
<p>19:8 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</p>
<p>19:9 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</p>
<p>19:10 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</p>
<p>19:11 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.</p>
<p>19:12 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</p>
<p>19:13 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</p>
<p>19:14 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</p>
<p>19:15 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</p>
<p>19:16 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</p>
<p>19:17 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.</p>
<p>19:18 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.</p>
<p>19:19 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</p>
<p>19:20 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</p>
<p>19:21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</p>
<p>19:22 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 19:23 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! 19:24 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! 19:25 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 19:26 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: 19:27 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</p>
<p>19:28 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? 19:29 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.</p>
<p>20:1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 20:2 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.</p>
<p>20:3 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</p>
<p>20:4 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth, 20:5 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? 20:6 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; 20:7 Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? 20:8 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</p>
<p>20:9 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.</p>
<p>20:10 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.</p>
<p>20:11 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</p>
<p>20:12 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; 20:13 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: 20:14 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.</p>
<p>20:15 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</p>
<p>20:16 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.</p>
<p>20:17 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.</p>
<p>20:18 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.</p>
<p>20:19 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; 20:20 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</p>
<p>20:21 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.</p>
<p>20:22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</p>
<p>20:23 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.</p>
<p>20:24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.</p>
<p>20:25 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.</p>
<p>20:26 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</p>
<p>20:27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.</p>
<p>20:28 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</p>
<p>20:29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</p>
<p>21:1 But Job answered and said, 21:2 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</p>
<p>21:3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</p>
<p>21:4 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? 21:5 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</p>
<p>21:6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</p>
<p>21:7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? 21:8 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p>21:9 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</p>
<p>21:10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</p>
<p>21:11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</p>
<p>21:12 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</p>
<p>21:13 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</p>
<p>21:14 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
<p>21:15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 21:16 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p>21:17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.</p>
<p>21:18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.</p>
<p>21:19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.</p>
<p>21:20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p>21:21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 21:22 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.</p>
<p>21:23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</p>
<p>21:24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</p>
<p>21:25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.</p>
<p>21:26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</p>
<p>21:27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.</p>
<p>21:28 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? 21:29 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 21:30 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</p>
<p>21:31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? 21:32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.</p>
<p>21:33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.</p>
<p>21:34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? 22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 22:2 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 22:3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 22:4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? 22:5 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? 22:6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</p>
<p>22:7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</p>
<p>22:8 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.</p>
<p>22:9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</p>
<p>22:10 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; 22:11 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.</p>
<p>22:12 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 22:13 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 22:14 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</p>
<p>22:15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? 22:16 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: 22:17 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? 22:18 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p>22:19 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</p>
<p>22:20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.</p>
<p>22:21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</p>
<p>22:22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</p>
<p>22:23 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</p>
<p>22:24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</p>
<p>22:25 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.</p>
<p>22:26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</p>
<p>22:27 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</p>
<p>22:28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</p>
<p>22:29 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.</p>
<p>22:30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.</p>
<p>23:1 Then Job answered and said, 23:2 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</p>
<p>23:3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! 23:4 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</p>
<p>23:5 I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</p>
<p>23:6 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.</p>
<p>23:7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</p>
<p>23:8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: 23:9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him: 23:10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>
<p>23:11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</p>
<p>23:12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</p>
<p>23:13 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.</p>
<p>23:14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.</p>
<p>23:15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</p>
<p>23:16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: 23:17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.</p>
<p>24:1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? 24:2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.</p>
<p>24:3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.</p>
<p>24:4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</p>
<p>24:5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.</p>
<p>24:6 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</p>
<p>24:7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.</p>
<p>24:8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</p>
<p>24:9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</p>
<p>24:10 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; 24:11 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</p>
<p>24:12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.</p>
<p>24:13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</p>
<p>24:14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</p>
<p>24:15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.</p>
<p>24:16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</p>
<p>24:17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.</p>
<p>24:18 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</p>
<p>24:19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.</p>
<p>24:20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</p>
<p>24:21 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.</p>
<p>24:22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.</p>
<p>24:23 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.</p>
<p>24:24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</p>
<p>24:25 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth? 25:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 25:2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.</p>
<p>25:3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? 25:4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 25:5 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.</p>
<p>25:6 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm? 26:1 But Job answered and said, 26:2 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? 26:3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 26:4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? 26:5 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.</p>
<p>26:6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</p>
<p>26:7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</p>
<p>26:8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</p>
<p>26:9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.</p>
<p>26:10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</p>
<p>26:11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</p>
<p>26:12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.</p>
<p>26:13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.</p>
<p>26:14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? 27:1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 27:2 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul; 27:3 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; 27:4 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.</p>
<p>27:5 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.</p>
<p>27:6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</p>
<p>27:7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.</p>
<p>27:8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? 27:9 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? 27:10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? 27:11 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.</p>
<p>27:12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain? 27:13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.</p>
<p>27:14 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p>27:15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.</p>
<p>27:16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; 27:17 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.</p>
<p>27:18 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.</p>
<p>27:19 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.</p>
<p>27:20 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.</p>
<p>27:21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.</p>
<p>27:22 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.</p>
<p>27:23 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.</p>
<p>28:1 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.</p>
<p>28:2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.</p>
<p>28:3 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.</p>
<p>28:4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.</p>
<p>28:5 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.</p>
<p>28:6 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.</p>
<p>28:7 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: 28:8 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.</p>
<p>28:9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.</p>
<p>28:10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.</p>
<p>28:11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.</p>
<p>28:12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? 28:13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</p>
<p>28:14 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.</p>
<p>28:15 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</p>
<p>28:16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</p>
<p>28:17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.</p>
<p>28:18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.</p>
<p>28:19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</p>
<p>28:20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 28:21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</p>
<p>28:22 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.</p>
<p>28:23 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</p>
<p>28:24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; 28:25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.</p>
<p>28:26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: 28:27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.</p>
<p>28:28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</p>
<p>29:1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 29:2 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; 29:3 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; 29:4 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; 29:5 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me; 29:6 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 29:7 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street! 29:8 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.</p>
<p>29:9 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.</p>
<p>29:10 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</p>
<p>29:11 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: 29:12 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.</p>
<p>29:13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</p>
<p>29:14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.</p>
<p>29:15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</p>
<p>29:16 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</p>
<p>29:17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</p>
<p>29:18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.</p>
<p>29:19 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</p>
<p>29:20 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</p>
<p>29:21 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</p>
<p>29:22 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</p>
<p>29:23 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</p>
<p>29:24 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</p>
<p>29:25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.</p>
<p>30:1 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.</p>
<p>30:2 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished? 30:3 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</p>
<p>30:4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.</p>
<p>30:5 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;) 30:6 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.</p>
<p>30:7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</p>
<p>30:8 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</p>
<p>30:9 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</p>
<p>30:10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</p>
<p>30:11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</p>
<p>30:12 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</p>
<p>30:13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</p>
<p>30:14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.</p>
<p>30:15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</p>
<p>30:16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>
<p>30:17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</p>
<p>30:18 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</p>
<p>30:19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</p>
<p>30:20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.</p>
<p>30:21 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</p>
<p>30:22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.</p>
<p>30:23 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</p>
<p>30:24 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</p>
<p>30:25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor? 30:26 When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>
<p>30:27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</p>
<p>30:28 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.</p>
<p>30:29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</p>
<p>30:30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</p>
<p>30:31 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</p>
<p>31:1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? 31:2 For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 31:3 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? 31:4 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? 31:5 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 31:6 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.</p>
<p>31:7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 31:8 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.</p>
<p>31:9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door; 31:10 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.</p>
<p>31:11 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.</p>
<p>31:12 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.</p>
<p>31:13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; 31:14 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 31:15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? 31:16 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 31:17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; 31:18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) 31:19 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; 31:20 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 31:21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: 31:22 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.</p>
<p>31:23 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</p>
<p>31:24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; 31:25 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; 31:26 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; 31:27 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: 31:28 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.</p>
<p>31:29 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: 31:30 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.</p>
<p>31:31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</p>
<p>31:32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.</p>
<p>31:33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: 31:34 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door? 31:35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.</p>
<p>31:36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.</p>
<p>31:37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.</p>
<p>31:38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; 31:39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 31:40 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.</p>
<p>The words of Job are ended.</p>
<p>32:1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</p>
<p>32:2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</p>
<p>32:3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</p>
<p>32:4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</p>
<p>32:5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</p>
<p>32:6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</p>
<p>32:7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</p>
<p>32:8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</p>
<p>32:9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</p>
<p>32:10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</p>
<p>32:11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</p>
<p>32:12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words: 32:13 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</p>
<p>32:14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</p>
<p>32:15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</p>
<p>32:16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;) 32:17 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</p>
<p>32:18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</p>
<p>32:19 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</p>
<p>32:20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</p>
<p>32:21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</p>
<p>32:22 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.</p>
<p>33:1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</p>
<p>33:2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</p>
<p>33:3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</p>
<p>33:4 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</p>
<p>33:5 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.</p>
<p>33:6 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</p>
<p>33:7 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</p>
<p>33:8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, 33:9 I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</p>
<p>33:10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, 33:11 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</p>
<p>33:12 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</p>
<p>33:13 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</p>
<p>33:14 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</p>
<p>33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 33:16 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, 33:17 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</p>
<p>33:18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
<p>33:19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: 33:20 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</p>
<p>33:21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</p>
<p>33:22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</p>
<p>33:23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: 33:24 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</p>
<p>33:25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth: 33:26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</p>
<p>33:27 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; 33:28 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</p>
<p>33:29 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 33:30 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
<p>33:31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</p>
<p>33:32 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</p>
<p>33:33 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</p>
<p>34:1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 34:2 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</p>
<p>34:3 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</p>
<p>34:4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</p>
<p>34:5 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</p>
<p>34:6 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</p>
<p>34:7 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? 34:8 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</p>
