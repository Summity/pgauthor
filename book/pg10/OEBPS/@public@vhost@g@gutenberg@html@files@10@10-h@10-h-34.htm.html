<body><p>92:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.</p>
<p>92:4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</p>
<p>92:5 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.</p>
<p>92:6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.</p>
<p>92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:</p>
<p>92:8 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.</p>
<p>92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</p>
<p>92:10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.</p>
<p>92:11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.</p>
<p>92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</p>
<p>92:13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.</p>
<p>92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;</p>
<p>92:15 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</p>
<p>93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.</p>
<p>93:2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.</p>
<p>93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.</p>
<p>93:4 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.</p>
<p>93:5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.</p>
<p>94:1 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.</p>
<p>94:2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.</p>
<p>94:3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?</p>
<p>94:4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?</p>
<p>94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.</p>
<p>94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.</p>
<p>94:7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.</p>
<p>94:8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?</p>
<p>94:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?</p>
<p>94:10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?</p>
<p>94:11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.</p>
<p>94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;</p>
<p>94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.</p>
<p>94:14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.</p>
<p>94:15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.</p>
<p>94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p>94:17 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.</p>
<p>94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.</p>
<p>94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.</p>
<p>94:20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?</p>
<p>94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.</p>
<p>94:22 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.</p>
<p>94:23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.</p>
<p>95:1 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.</p>
<p>95:2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.</p>
<p>95:3 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.</p>
<p>95:4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.</p>
<p>95:5 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.</p>
<p>95:6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.</p>
<p>95:7 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,</p>
<p>95:8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</p>
<p>95:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.</p>
<p>95:10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:</p>
<p>95:11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.</p>
<p>96:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.</p>
<p>96:2 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.</p>
<p>96:3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.</p>
<p>96:4 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.</p>
<p>96:5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.</p>
<p>96:6 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.</p>
<p>96:7 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.</p>
<p>96:8 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.</p>
<p>96:9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.</p>
<p>96:10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.</p>
<p>96:11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.</p>
<p>96:12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice</p>
<p>96:13 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.</p>
<p>97:1 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.</p>
<p>97:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</p>
<p>97:3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.</p>
<p>97:4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.</p>
<p>97:5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.</p>
<p>97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.</p>
<p>97:7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.</p>
<p>97:8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.</p>
<p>97:9 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.</p>
<p>97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.</p>
<p>97:11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.</p>
<p>97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</p>
<p>98:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.</p>
<p>98:2 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.</p>
<p>98:3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>
<p>98:4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.</p>
<p>98:5 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.</p>
<p>98:6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.</p>
<p>98:7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</p>
<p>98:8 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together</p>
<p>98:9 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.</p>
<p>99:1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.</p>
<p>99:2 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.</p>
<p>99:3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.</p>
<p>99:4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.</p>
<p>99:5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.</p>
<p>99:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.</p>
<p>99:7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.</p>
<p>99:8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.</p>
<p>99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.</p>
<p>100:1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.</p>
<p>100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.</p>
<p>100:3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.</p>
<p>100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.</p>
<p>100:5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.</p>
<p>101:1 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.</p>
<p>101:2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</p>
<p>101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.</p>
<p>101:4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.</p>
<p>101:5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.</p>
<p>101:6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.</p>
<p>101:7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.</p>
<p>101:8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.</p>
<p>102:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.</p>
<p>102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.</p>
<p>102:3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.</p>
<p>102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.</p>
<p>102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.</p>
<p>102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.</p>
<p>102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</p>
<p>102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.</p>
<p>102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.</p>
<p>102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</p>
<p>102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.</p>
<p>102:12 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</p>
<p>102:13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.</p>
<p>102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</p>
<p>102:15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</p>
<p>102:16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</p>
<p>102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</p>
<p>102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</p>
<p>102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;</p>
<p>102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;</p>
<p>102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</p>
<p>102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</p>
<p>102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.</p>
<p>102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.</p>
<p>102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</p>
<p>102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:</p>
<p>102:27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.</p>
<p>102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</p>
<p>103:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.</p>
<p>103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</p>
<p>103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</p>
<p>103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</p>
<p>103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.</p>
<p>103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</p>
<p>103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p>103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</p>
<p>103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.</p>
<p>103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p>
<p>103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</p>
<p>103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</p>
<p>103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</p>
<p>103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.</p>
<p>103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</p>
<p>103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</p>
<p>103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;</p>
<p>103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</p>
<p>103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</p>
<p>103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.</p>
<p>103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</p>
<p>103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.</p>
<p>104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</p>
<p>104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</p>
<p>104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</p>
<p>104:4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</p>
<p>104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.</p>
<p>104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</p>
<p>104:7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</p>
<p>104:8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</p>
<p>104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</p>
<p>104:10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.</p>
<p>104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.</p>
<p>104:12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.</p>
<p>104:13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</p>
<p>104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</p>
<p>104:15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.</p>
<p>104:16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</p>
<p>104:17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.</p>
<p>104:18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.</p>
<p>104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</p>
<p>104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.</p>
<p>104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</p>
<p>104:22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</p>
<p>104:23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</p>
<p>104:24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</p>
<p>104:25 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.</p>
<p>104:26 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.</p>
<p>104:27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.</p>
<p>104:28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</p>
<p>104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</p>
<p>104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</p>
<p>104:31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.</p>
<p>104:32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</p>
<p>104:33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>
<p>104:34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.</p>
<p>104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>105:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</p>
<p>105:2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>
<p>105:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>
<p>105:4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</p>
<p>105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>
<p>105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</p>
<p>105:7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</p>
<p>105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>
<p>105:9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</p>
<p>105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</p>
<p>105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</p>
<p>105:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p>105:13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;</p>
<p>105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</p>
<p>105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
<p>105:16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</p>
<p>105:17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:</p>
<p>105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</p>
<p>105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</p>
<p>105:20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</p>
<p>105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</p>
<p>105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</p>
<p>105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>
<p>105:24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</p>
<p>105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</p>
<p>105:26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.</p>
<p>105:27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</p>
<p>105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</p>
<p>105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</p>
<p>105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</p>
<p>105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.</p>
<p>105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.</p>
<p>105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</p>
<p>105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</p>
<p>105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>
<p>105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</p>
<p>105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.</p>
<p>105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</p>
<p>105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</p>
<p>105:40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p>
<p>105:41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.</p>
<p>105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.</p>
<p>105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:</p>
<p>105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</p>
<p>105:45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?</p>
<p>106:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.</p>
<p>106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</p>
<p>106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</p>
<p>106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</p>
<p>106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.</p>
<p>106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>
<p>106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>
<p>106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p>106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</p>
<p>106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>
<p>106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</p>
<p>106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</p>
<p>106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</p>
<p>106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.</p>
<p>106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
<p>106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>
<p>106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</p>
<p>106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</p>
<p>106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>
<p>106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.</p>
<p>106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</p>
<p>106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</p>
<p>106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</p>
<p>106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</p>
<p>106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>
<p>106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
<p>106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</p>
<p>106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</p>
<p>106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>
<p>106:32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>
<p>106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p>
<p>106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</p>
<p>106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</p>
<p>106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
<p>106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>
<p>106:38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p>106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>
<p>106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>
<p>106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p>106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
<p>106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
<p>106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</p>
<p>106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p>106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</p>
<p>106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</p>
<p>106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</p>
<p>107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</p>
<p>107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</p>
<p>107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>
<p>107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>
<p>107:8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</p>
<p>107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;</p>
<p>107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</p>
<p>107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.</p>
<p>107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</p>
<p>107:15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</p>
<p>107:17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p>
<p>107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</p>
<p>107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</p>
<p>107:21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</p>
<p>107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</p>
<p>107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</p>
<p>107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</p>
<p>107:26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>
<p>107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.</p>
<p>107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</p>
<p>107:30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>
<p>107:31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>
<p>107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</p>
<p>107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
<p>107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</p>
<p>107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</p>
<p>107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>
<p>107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>
<p>107:39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>
<p>107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</p>
<p>107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</p>
<p>107:42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>
<p>107:43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</p>
<p>108:1 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.</p>
<p>108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.</p>
<p>108:3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.</p>
<p>108:4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.</p>
<p>108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;</p>
<p>108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.</p>
<p>108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</p>
<p>108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;</p>
<p>108:9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.</p>
<p>108:10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</p>
<p>108:11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?</p>
<p>108:12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</p>
<p>108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.</p>
<p>109:1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</p>
<p>109:2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</p>
<p>109:3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</p>
<p>109:4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.</p>
<p>109:5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</p>
<p>109:6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</p>
<p>109:7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</p>
<p>109:8 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.</p>
<p>109:9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>
<p>109:10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.</p>
<p>109:11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</p>
<p>109:12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</p>
<p>109:13 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</p>
<p>109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>
<p>109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</p>
<p>109:16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</p>
<p>109:17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</p>
<p>109:18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</p>
<p>109:19 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</p>
<p>109:20 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</p>
<p>109:21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.</p>
<p>109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</p>
<p>109:23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</p>
<p>109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</p>
<p>109:25 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</p>
<p>109:26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</p>
<p>109:27 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.</p>
<p>109:28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</p>
<p>109:29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</p>
<p>109:30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</p>
<p>109:31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.</p>
<p>110:1 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>
<p>110:2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</p>
<p>110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.</p>
<p>110:4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>110:5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.</p>
<p>110:6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.</p>
<p>110:7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.</p>
<p>111:1 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.</p>
<p>111:2 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.</p>
<p>111:3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</p>
<p>111:4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.</p>
<p>111:5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.</p>
<p>111:6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.</p>
<p>111:7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.</p>
<p>111:8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.</p>
<p>111:9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.</p>
<p>111:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.</p>
<p>112:1 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.</p>
<p>112:2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.</p>
<p>112:3 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</p>
<p>112:4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.</p>
<p>112:5 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.</p>
<p>112:6 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.</p>
<p>112:7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.</p>
<p>112:8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.</p>
<p>112:9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.</p>
<p>112:10 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<p>113:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.</p>
<p>113:3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised.</p>
<p>113:4 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.</p>
<p>113:5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,</p>
<p>113:6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!</p>
<p>113:7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;</p>
<p>113:8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.</p>
<p>113:9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>114:1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;</p>
<p>114:2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.</p>
<p>114:3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.</p>
<p>114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.</p>
<p>114:5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?</p>
<p>114:6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?</p>
<p>114:7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;</p>
<p>114:8 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.</p>
<p>115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.</p>
<p>115:2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?</p>
<p>115:3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.</p>
<p>115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.</p>
<p>115:5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:</p>
<p>115:6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:</p>
<p>115:7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.</p>
<p>115:8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.</p>
<p>115:9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.</p>
<p>115:10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.</p>
<p>115:11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.</p>
<p>115:12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.</p>
<p>115:13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.</p>
<p>115:14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.</p>
<p>115:15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.</p>
<p>115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.</p>
<p>115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.</p>
<p>Praise the LORD.</p>
<p>116:1 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.</p>
<p>116:2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</p>
<p>116:3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.</p>
<p>116:4 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.</p>
<p>116:5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.</p>
<p>116:6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.</p>
<p>116:7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.</p>
<p>116:8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.</p>
<p>116:9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.</p>
<p>116:10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:</p>
<p>116:11 I said in my haste, All men are liars.</p>
<p>116:12 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?</p>
<p>116:13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>116:14 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.</p>
<p>116:15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.</p>
<p>116:16 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.</p>
<p>116:17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.</p>
<p>116:18 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.</p>
<p>116:19 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>117:1 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.</p>
<p>117:2 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
<p>118:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>118:2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>118:4 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>118:5 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.</p>
<p>118:6 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?</p>
<p>118:7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.</p>
<p>118:8 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.</p>
<p>118:9 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.</p>
<p>118:10 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.</p>
<p>118:11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>
<p>118:12 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>
<p>118:13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.</p>
<p>118:14 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.</p>
<p>118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.</p>
<p>118:16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.</p>
<p>118:17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.</p>
<p>118:18 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.</p>
<p>118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:</p>
<p>118:20 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.</p>
<p>118:21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.</p>
<p>118:22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.</p>
<p>118:23 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.</p>
<p>118:24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.</p>
<p>118:25 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.</p>
<p>118:26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>118:27 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.</p>
<p>118:28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.</p>
<p>118:29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>119:1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.</p>
<p>119:2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.</p>
<p>119:3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.</p>
<p>119:4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.</p>
<p>119:5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!</p>
<p>119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p>119:8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.</p>
<p>119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.</p>
<p>119:12 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.</p>
<p>119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.</p>
<p>119:15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.</p>
<p>119:16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.</p>
<p>119:17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.</p>
<p>119:18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</p>
<p>119:19 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.</p>
<p>119:20 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.</p>
<p>119:21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:22 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:23 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.</p>
<p>119:25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:26 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.</p>
<p>119:28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.</p>
<p>119:29 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.</p>
<p>119:30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.</p>
<p>119:31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.</p>
<p>119:32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.</p>
<p>119:33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.</p>
<p>119:34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.</p>
<p>119:35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.</p>
<p>119:36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.</p>
<p>119:37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.</p>
<p>119:38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.</p>
<p>119:39 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.</p>
<p>119:40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.</p>
<p>119:41 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.</p>
<p>119:43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.</p>
<p>119:44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.</p>
<p>119:45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.</p>
<p>119:47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.</p>
<p>119:48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</p>
<p>119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.</p>
<p>119:51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.</p>
<p>119:52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.</p>
<p>119:53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.</p>
<p>119:54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.</p>
<p>119:55 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.</p>
<p>119:56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:57 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.</p>
<p>119:58 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.</p>
<p>119:59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.</p>
<p>119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p>119:63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.</p>
<p>119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.</p>
<p>119:68 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:69 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.</p>
<p>119:70 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.</p>
<p>119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.</p>
<p>119:73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.</p>
<p>119:74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.</p>
<p>119:75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.</p>
<p>119:76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.</p>
<p>119:77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.</p>
<p>119:78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.</p>
<p>119:81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.</p>
<p>119:82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?</p>
<p>119:83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.</p>
<p>119:84 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?</p>
<p>119:85 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.</p>
<p>119:86 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.</p>
<p>119:87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.</p>
<p>119:89 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.</p>
<p>119:90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.</p>
<p>119:91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.</p>
<p>119:92 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.</p>
<p>119:93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.</p>
<p>119:94 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:96 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.</p>
<p>119:97 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.</p>
<p>119:98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.</p>
<p>119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.</p>
<p>119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.</p>
<p>119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.</p>
<p>119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!</p>
<p>119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.</p>
<p>119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</p>
<p>119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p>119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.</p>
<p>119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.</p>
<p>119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.</p>
<p>119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.</p>
<p>119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.</p>
<p>119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.</p>
<p>119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.</p>
<p>119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.</p>
<p>119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.</p>
<p>119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.</p>
<p>119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.</p>
<p>119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.</p>
<p>119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.</p>
<p>119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.</p>
<p>119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.</p>
