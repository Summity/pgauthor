<body><p>16:14 Let all your things be done with charity.</p>
<p>16:15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) 16:16 That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.</p>
<p>16:17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.</p>
<p>16:18 For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.</p>
<p>16:19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</p>
<p>16:20 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.</p>
<p>16:21 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.</p>
<p>16:22 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</p>
<p>16:23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>
<p>16:24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00049"><a id="The_Second_Epistle_of_Paul_the_Apostle_to_the_Corinthians"/>The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia: 1:2 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>1:3 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; 1:4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</p>
<p>1:5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</p>
<p>1:6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.</p>
<p>1:7 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.</p>
<p>1:8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: 1:9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: 1:10 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us; 1:11 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</p>
<p>1:12 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</p>
<p>1:13 For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; 1:14 As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>1:15 And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit; 1:16 And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.</p>
<p>1:17 When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? 1:18 But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.</p>
<p>1:19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.</p>
<p>1:20 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</p>
<p>1:21 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; 1:22 Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</p>
<p>1:23 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.</p>
<p>1:24 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</p>
<p>2:1 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</p>
<p>2:2 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? 2:3 And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</p>
<p>2:4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</p>
<p>2:5 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</p>
<p>2:6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</p>
<p>2:7 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</p>
<p>2:8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</p>
<p>2:9 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</p>
<p>2:10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ; 2:11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
<p>2:12 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 2:13 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</p>
<p>2:14 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</p>
<p>2:15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: 2:16 To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? 2:17 For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</p>
<p>3:1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you? 3:2 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: 3:3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</p>
<p>3:4 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 3:5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; 3:6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</p>
<p>3:7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: 3:8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? 3:9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</p>
<p>3:10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</p>
<p>3:11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</p>
<p>3:12 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: 3:13 And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: 3:14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.</p>
<p>3:15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.</p>
<p>3:16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.</p>
<p>3:17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</p>
<p>3:18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.</p>
<p>4:1 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; 4:2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</p>
<p>4:3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 4:4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</p>
<p>4:5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.</p>
<p>4:6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>4:7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</p>
<p>4:8 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 4:9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; 4:10 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.</p>
<p>4:11 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</p>
<p>4:12 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</p>
<p>4:13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; 4:14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.</p>
<p>4:15 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.</p>
<p>4:16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</p>
<p>4:17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; 4:18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</p>
<p>5:1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</p>
<p>5:2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: 5:3 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</p>
<p>5:4 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</p>
<p>5:5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</p>
<p>5:6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 5:7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 5:8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</p>
<p>5:9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</p>
<p>5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</p>
<p>5:11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</p>
<p>5:12 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</p>
<p>5:13 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.</p>
<p>5:14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: 5:15 And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</p>
<p>5:16 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</p>
<p>5:17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</p>
<p>5:18 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; 5:19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</p>
<p>5:20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</p>
<p>5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</p>
<p>6:1 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</p>
<p>6:2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.) 6:3 Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: 6:4 But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 6:5 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 6:6 By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, 6:7 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 6:8 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; 6:9 As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; 6:10 As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</p>
<p>6:11 O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.</p>
<p>6:12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.</p>
<p>6:13 Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.</p>
<p>6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? 6:15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? 6:16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p>6:17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.</p>
<p>6:18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</p>
<p>7:1 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</p>
<p>7:2 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</p>
<p>7:3 I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.</p>
<p>7:4 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</p>
<p>7:5 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.</p>
<p>7:6 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus; 7:7 And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</p>
<p>7:8 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.</p>
<p>7:9 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.</p>
<p>7:10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</p>
<p>7:11 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</p>
<p>7:12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</p>
<p>7:13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</p>
<p>7:14 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.</p>
<p>7:15 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.</p>
<p>7:16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.</p>
<p>8:1 Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; 8:2 How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</p>
<p>8:3 For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; 8:4 Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.</p>
<p>8:5 And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</p>
<p>8:6 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</p>
<p>8:7 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.</p>
<p>8:8 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</p>
<p>8:9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</p>
<p>8:10 And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</p>
<p>8:11 Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.</p>
<p>8:12 For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</p>
<p>8:13 For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: 8:14 But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality: 8:15 As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.</p>
<p>8:16 But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</p>
<p>8:17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.</p>
<p>8:18 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches; 8:19 And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind: 8:20 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: 8:21 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</p>
<p>8:22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.</p>
<p>8:23 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.</p>
<p>8:24 Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</p>
<p>9:1 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: 9:2 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.</p>
<p>9:3 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: 9:4 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.</p>
<p>9:5 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.</p>
<p>9:6 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</p>
<p>9:7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</p>
<p>9:8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: 9:9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.</p>
<p>9:10 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;) 9:11 Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.</p>
<p>9:12 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; 9:13 Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; 9:14 And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.</p>
<p>9:15 Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.</p>
<p>10:1 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: 10:2 But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</p>
<p>10:3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: 10:4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) 10:5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; 10:6 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</p>
<p>10:7 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.</p>
<p>10:8 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: 10:9 That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.</p>
<p>10:10 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</p>
<p>10:11 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.</p>
<p>10:12 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</p>
<p>10:13 But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</p>
<p>10:14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ: 10:15 Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, 10:16 To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.</p>
<p>10:17 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>
<p>10:18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</p>
<p>11:1 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.</p>
<p>11:2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.</p>
<p>11:3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</p>
<p>11:4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.</p>
<p>11:5 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</p>
<p>11:6 But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.</p>
<p>11:7 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? 11:8 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.</p>
<p>11:9 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.</p>
<p>11:10 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.</p>
<p>11:11 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.</p>
<p>11:12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.</p>
<p>11:13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</p>
<p>11:14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</p>
<p>11:15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</p>
<p>11:16 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.</p>
<p>11:17 That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</p>
<p>11:18 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</p>
<p>11:19 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.</p>
<p>11:20 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.</p>
<p>11:21 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</p>
<p>11:22 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</p>
<p>11:23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.</p>
<p>11:24 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.</p>
<p>11:25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 11:26 In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; 11:27 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</p>
<p>11:28 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</p>
<p>11:29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? 11:30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.</p>
<p>11:31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.</p>
<p>11:32 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: 11:33 And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.</p>
<p>12:1 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</p>
<p>12:2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</p>
<p>12:3 And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) 12:4 How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
<p>12:5 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</p>
<p>12:6 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</p>
<p>12:7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</p>
<p>12:8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</p>
<p>12:9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</p>
<p>12:10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</p>
<p>12:11 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</p>
<p>12:12 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</p>
<p>12:13 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</p>
<p>12:14 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</p>
<p>12:15 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.</p>
<p>12:16 But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</p>
<p>12:17 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? 12:18 I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps? 12:19 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</p>
<p>12:20 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: 12:21 And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</p>
<p>13:1 This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.</p>
<p>13:2 I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare: 13:3 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.</p>
<p>13:4 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</p>
<p>13:5 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? 13:6 But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.</p>
<p>13:7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.</p>
<p>13:8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</p>
<p>13:9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.</p>
<p>13:10 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.</p>
<p>13:11 Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</p>
<p>13:12 Greet one another with an holy kiss.</p>
<p>13:13 All the saints salute you.</p>
<p>13:14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00050"><a id="The_Epistle_of_Paul_the_Apostle_to_the_Galatians"/>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 1:2 And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: 1:3 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, 1:4 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: 1:5 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 1:7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</p>
<p>1:9 As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>
<p>1:10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</p>
<p>1:11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</p>
<p>1:12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>1:13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: 1:14 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</p>
<p>1:15 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, 1:16 To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: 1:17 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</p>
<p>1:18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</p>
<p>1:19 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</p>
<p>1:20 Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</p>
<p>1:21 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 1:22 And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: 1:23 But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</p>
<p>1:24 And they glorified God in me.</p>
<p>2:1 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.</p>
<p>2:2 And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</p>
<p>2:3 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: 2:4 And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: 2:5 To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</p>
<p>2:6 But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: 2:7 But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; 2:8 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) 2:9 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</p>
<p>2:10 Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</p>
<p>2:11 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</p>
<p>2:12 For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</p>
<p>2:13 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</p>
<p>2:14 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? 2:15 We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, 2:16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</p>
<p>2:17 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</p>
<p>2:18 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</p>
<p>2:19 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</p>
<p>2:20 I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</p>
<p>2:21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</p>
<p>3:1 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? 3:2 This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 3:3 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? 3:4 Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.</p>
<p>3:5 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 3:6 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</p>
<p>3:7 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</p>
<p>3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.</p>
<p>3:9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</p>
<p>3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</p>
<p>3:11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</p>
<p>3:12 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.</p>
<p>3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: 3:14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</p>
<p>3:15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.</p>
<p>3:16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</p>
<p>3:17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</p>
<p>3:18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</p>
<p>3:19 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</p>
<p>3:20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</p>
<p>3:21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</p>
<p>3:22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</p>
<p>3:23 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</p>
<p>3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</p>
<p>3:25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</p>
<p>3:26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</p>
<p>3:28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>3:29 And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</p>
<p>4:1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 4:2 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</p>
<p>4:3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 4:5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</p>
<p>4:6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</p>
<p>4:7 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</p>
<p>4:8 Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</p>
<p>4:9 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? 4:10 Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</p>
<p>4:11 I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</p>
<p>4:12 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.</p>
<p>4:13 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.</p>
<p>4:14 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>4:15 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</p>
<p>4:16 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? 4:17 They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.</p>
<p>4:18 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</p>
<p>4:19 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, 4:20 I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</p>
<p>4:21 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? 4:22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</p>
<p>4:23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.</p>
<p>4:24 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</p>
<p>4:25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</p>
<p>4:26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</p>
<p>4:27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.</p>
<p>4:28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</p>
<p>4:29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.</p>
<p>4:30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</p>
<p>4:31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.</p>
<p>5:1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</p>
<p>5:2 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</p>
<p>5:3 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</p>
<p>5:4 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</p>
<p>5:5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</p>
<p>5:6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</p>
<p>5:7 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? 5:8 This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.</p>
<p>5:9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</p>
<p>5:10 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</p>
<p>5:11 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.</p>
<p>5:12 I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</p>
<p>5:13 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</p>
<p>5:14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
<p>5:15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</p>
<p>5:16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</p>
<p>5:17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</p>
<p>5:18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</p>
<p>5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 5:20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 5:23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</p>
<p>5:24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</p>
<p>5:25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>
<p>5:26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
<p>6:1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</p>
<p>6:2 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</p>
<p>6:3 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</p>
<p>6:4 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</p>
<p>6:5 For every man shall bear his own burden.</p>
<p>6:6 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</p>
<p>6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</p>
<p>6:8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</p>
<p>6:9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</p>
<p>6:10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</p>
<p>6:11 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</p>
<p>6:12 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>6:13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</p>
<p>6:14 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</p>
<p>6:15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</p>
<p>6:16 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</p>
<p>6:17 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>6:18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<p>1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: 1:2 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: 1:4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: 1:5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 1:6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</p>
<p>1:7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; 1:8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; 1:9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: 1:10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: 1:11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: 1:12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.</p>
<p>1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 1:14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</p>
<p>1:15 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, 1:16 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; 1:17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: 1:18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 1:19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, 1:20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, 1:21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: 1:22 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, 1:23 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</p>
<p>2:1 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; 2:2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: 2:3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</p>
<p>2:4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 2:5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) 2:6 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: 2:7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 2:9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.</p>
<p>2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</p>
<p>2:11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; 2:12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: 2:13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</p>
<p>2:14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; 2:15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; 2:16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: 2:17 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</p>
<p>2:18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.</p>
<p>2:19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; 2:20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; 2:21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: 2:22 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</p>
<p>3:1 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, 3:2 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: 3:3 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, 3:4 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) 3:5 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; 3:6 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: 3:7 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.</p>
<p>3:8 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; 3:9 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: 3:10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, 3:11 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 3:12 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.</p>
<p>3:13 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</p>
<p>3:14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 3:15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 3:16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; 3:17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 3:18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; 3:19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</p>
<p>3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 3:21 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</p>
<p>4:1 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, 4:2 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; 4:3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</p>
<p>4:4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; 4:5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 4:6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</p>
<p>4:7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</p>
<p>4:8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</p>
<p>4:9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? 4:10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) 4:11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 4:12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 4:13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 4:14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 4:15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: 4:16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.</p>
<p>4:17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, 4:18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: 4:19 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</p>
<p>4:20 But ye have not so learned Christ; 4:21 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: 4:22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; 4:23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; 4:24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</p>
<p>4:25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.</p>
<p>4:26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 4:27 Neither give place to the devil.</p>
<p>4:28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</p>
<p>4:29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.</p>
<p>4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</p>
<p>4:31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: 4:32 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</p>
<p>5:1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 5:2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</p>
<p>5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 5:4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</p>
<p>5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
<p>5:6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</p>
<p>5:7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</p>
<p>5:8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: 5:9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) 5:10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</p>
<p>5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</p>
<p>5:12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</p>
<p>5:13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</p>
<p>5:14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</p>
<p>5:15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 5:16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</p>
<p>5:17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.</p>
<p>5:18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; 5:19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 5:20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; 5:21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</p>
<p>5:22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</p>
<p>5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</p>
<p>5:24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</p>
<p>5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 5:26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 5:27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</p>
